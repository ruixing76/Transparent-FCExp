        "passage": "0: When Rebecca Holcombe stepped down as education secretary in March 2018, she went quietly despite apparent rifts with Gov.\n1: Phil Scott.\n2: When she announced last week that she was running to take Scott\u2019s job, she came out swinging.\n3: \"I joined Gov.\n4: Scott\u2019s administration because I took him at his word that he was serious about working to make Vermont more affordable and more equitable.\n5: I resigned when I realized that was just talk,\" Holcombe said in a statement announcing her run for governor in 2020.\n6: \"We need to create opportunity for every Vermonter to make our communities stronger,\" she added, \"but unfortunately, Gov.\n7: Scott is pushing for a statewide voucher program that would take millions from our public schools and funnel it to private schools that mostly serve privileged families.\n8: I simply couldn\u2019t sit quietly by while our governor was pushing policies that left so many Vermonters behind.\"\n9: It\u2019s no secret that Scott\u2019s positions on education funding are unpopular with Democrats and much of the education community.\n10: His proposal to increase staff-to-student ratio in schools \u2014 in part by having teachers take on classes outside their expertise \u2014 was derided as soon as it arrived in the Statehouse near the end of the 2018 legislative session.\n11: But Holcombe\u2019s claim that Scott is \"pushing for a statewide voucher program\" seemed to open a new line of attack against the governor \u2014 one that was sure to strike a nerve with those worried about how Scott\u2019s small-government philosophy will guide his education plans.\n12: Such a change would revolutionize the relationship between Vermont communities and their schools.\n13: It would essentially create a free market for education, giving parents and guardians an annual voucher and letting them send their children to the school of their choice \u2014 independent or public \u2014 as opposed to the one in their district.\n14: Seven Days and the Rutland Herald have already looked into Holcombe\u2019s attention-grabbing claim, which is still posted on her campaign website .\n15: We decided the first shot fired in the 2020 gubernatorial race was worth putting to the Politifact test.\n16: Holcombe declined to be interviewed on the record about her claim, but sent an emailed statement defending her statement.\n17: \"As the Secretary of Education, I spoke weekly with the heads of Gov.\n18: Scott\u2019s administration and they made clear that their priority was protecting and expanding private school vouchers, including to schools that don't serve all students,\" she said in an emailed statement Tuesday.\n19: Holcombe also pointed to a memo from her successor as education secretary, Dan French, \"detailing their proposal to create a single statewide school district and statewide voucher program by expanding school choice to non-sectarian independent schools in every part of the state.\"\n20: That memo, titled \"Designing Our Future: A Blueprint for Transforming Vermont\u2019s Education System,\" was provided to VTDigger in December and then discussed openly before the State Board of Education in March.\n21: According to the memo itself, it was developed with participation from the governor\u2019s office and his cabinet, including the secretaries of Commerce and Community Development, Digital Services and Human Services, the commissioner of Labor.\n22: It says in part: \"The system would consist of a single statewide school district.\n23: Students would have statewide school choice among all the public schools, technical centers, and non-sectarian independent schools approved by the Agency.\"\n24: However, the preface to the memo also says: \"This document represents the work of a visioning exercise conducted within the Vermont Agency of Education to begin to imagine the design of a modern education system.\"\n25: Responding to questions from state board members in March, French said the memo was intended as a starting place for discussion about the future of Vermont schools, rather than a final policy proposal.\n26: French said the two most controversial ideas laid out in his memo \u2014 a statewide voucher system and a single statewide school district \u2014 were not final answers but rather an effort to spark new ideas to address systemic challenges.\n27: The secretary said he was looking for ways \"to stimulate a conversation and interest in the future around our policy design.\"\n28: French said Vermont needed to come up with a more efficient way to manage it\u2019s schools, both for cost control and to achieve better student outcomes.\n29: \"My conclusion is the system is overly complex, especially when considering the scale of the system, meaning the number of school districts and the number of students,\" he said.\n30: \"Complexity is the chief cause of our inefficiency.\"\n31: One logical solution to the problem of complexity, French said, was a single school district.\n32: And in order to give parents maximum flexibility in this system, he added, expanding vouchers would break down barriers within the system.\n33: \"That\u2019s where I come to the school choice idea, it\u2019s not as a philosophy, it\u2019s if we had fewer barriers there\u2019s more flexibility,\" he explained.\n34: \"But the idea would be, well, if you don\u2019t like that conclusion, let\u2019s go back and have a serious conversation about design elements.\"\n35: So does French\u2019s memo, combined with his appearance at the state board, amount to the Scott administration \"pushing\" a statewide voucher program?\n36: Without knowing more about internal conversations that Holcombe may have been a part of, it\u2019s hard to say.\n37: But French\u2019s tepid presentation before the board, speaking about a memo explicitly described as a conversation starter, does not amount to the administration pushing policy.\n38: Speaking on Vermont Public Radio on the same week the Blueprint was leaked publicly, Scott said he gave French \"great credit\" for bringing new ideas to the table.\n39: But he also suggested such a radical transformation was not the works.\n40: \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for anything like that at this point,\" he said of the single school-district idea.\n41: Ethan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, said in an email this week that the governor supports the expansion of vouchers if that decision is made at the local level.\n42: \"The Governor supports school choice and thinks it\u2019s a valuable tool for parents,\" Latour wrote.\n43: \"If the electorate of a school district or supervisory union feels similarly about choice among the schools within its boundaries \u2013 and to be clear these are public schools in most cases \u2013 the Governor would support those local decisions.\"\n44: Latour added that the governor would like to see districts that have merged under Act 46 offer school choice to families within those new, sometimes multischool, districts.\n45: \"This option, encouraged by current law, increases options for children and parents and helps local education districts preserve and expand academic programs,\" he said.\n46: So it\u2019s clear that Scott does support expanding school choice, though not necessarily on a statewide scale.\n47: His usual spokesperson, Rebecca Kelley (who was on vacation this week), clarified earlier this month that the governor \"has not proposed or pursued a statewide voucher program.\"",

Chuck Schumer a Half True rating for claiming that Republicans were proposing \"to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid.\"\n38: We noted at the time that drawing a direct link between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts was exaggerated since they were separate pieces of legislation.\n39: The Priorities USA ad makes a different claim, starting with the fact it refers to just Medicare (not Medicare and Medicaid) and, instead of \"the rich,\" it refers specifically to billionaires.\n40: In addition, we\u2019re now dealing with the final version of the tax cuts and a firm budget proposal.\n41: That said, the ad does connect the two pieces of legislation in the way Schumer did, which we noted is problematic.\n42: Finally, Fiedler notes that \u2014\u00a0broadly speaking \u2014\u00a0cutting taxes does require other adjustments be made.\n43: \"Tax cuts aren\u2019t a free lunch: lower tax revenue will lead to higher deficits, which will require either future tax increases or spending cuts,\" he said in an email.\n44: \"Medicare is a substantial fraction of federal spending, so it\u2019s certainly possible that Medicare would bear a portion of those future adjustments, but it\u2019s impossible to say with any precision where those adjustments would ultimately fall.\"",

        "passage": "0: Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump\u2018s hardline stance on immigration has driven the nation\u2019s current refugee crisis to all-time highs.\n1: \"What we\u2019ve seen at the border in the last several months has been shocking and unprecedented,\" Durbin said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n2: \"This get-tough president who says he\u2019s going to cut off foreign aid to countries in Central America and get tough at the border with his almighty wall has ended up attracting larger numbers of people coming to the United States presenting themselves for asylum status at our border than we\u2019ve ever seen,\" the four-term Illinois senator said.\n3: \"Dramatic increases we haven\u2019t seen for decades in people at the border.\"\n4: It\u2019s been widely reported that undocumented migrants are being intercepted by federal border agents or surrendering themselves along the border at levels not seen in decades, despite the president\u2019s continued calls to curtail immigration.\n5: But has that rapid surge \u2014 still well below the 1.6 million peak in southwest border apprehensions 19 years ago \u2014 been accompanied by an unprecedented rise in migrants seeking asylum protections?\n6: And, if so, is it possible to say whether Trump played the central role in drawing them here?\n7: We decided to find out.\n8: Asylum claims hit new high To examine Durbin\u2019s assertions, we took a look at what is known as \"credible fear\" claims, the first step undocumented migrants at the border must take to seek asylum by claiming to fear racial, political, social or religious persecution at home.\n9: Data on the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol\u2019s website shows the number of migrants making such claims at the southwest border rose from 55,584 in 2017 to 92,959 the following fiscal year, a nearly 70% increase.\n10: The Customs site didn\u2019t have data for previous years.\n11: A Durbin spokesperson referred us to an article about those recent CBP numbers, but did not provide any historical data.\n12: Still, there are other ways of tracking fear claims that suggest Durbin may be correct on this count.\n13: We looked at more data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , the U.S.\n14: Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which screens migrants who make credible fear claims, and other sources.\n15: By all those measures, the claim that asylum seekers are arriving at record levels seems to check out, though not all track fear claims made at the southwest border specifically.\n16: The USCIS numbers, for instance, show that in 2006 about 5,000 migrants made credible fear claims.\n17: In 2018 , that total surged to more than 99,000.\n18: Those figures include claims of credible fear at all borders and ports of entry, but a majority come from Central American migrants, who are likely to enter at the southwest border.\n19: The upward trend began under President Barack Obama when in 2014 a migration surge occurred, driven in part by unaccompanied children fleeing violence and insecurity in Central America.\n20: But in none of those years did total claims pass the highs reported by USCIS for 2018.\n21: The Trump administration highlighted the USCIS claims numbers \u2014 which represent a nearly 1,800% increase between 2006 and 2018 \u2014 as part of its justification for a new rule that bars most migrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border from applying for asylum if they have not first sought refuge in one of the countries they traveled through.\n22: Announced earlier this month, that rule is temporarily blocked by a court challenge .\n23: The shifting demographic profile of migrants showing up at the border today also suggests greater numbers of asylum seekers, experts told us.\n24: For decades, most crossing the southwest border without permission were single men from Mexico looking for work.\n25: Today, migrants are more likely to come from a violence- and poverty-stricken region known as the Northern Triangle that includes El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n26: And the number of border apprehensions involving families has hit record levels, according to the CBP .\n27: Groups that include at least one child with parent or guardian now account for more than half of those seeking to cross.\n28: Unaccompanied minors arriving at the border are also on the rise, although that total has yet to surpass 2014\u2019s numbers.\n29: Durbin\u2019s broader argument is somewhat of a stretch While there\u2019s a case for Durbin\u2019s argument that asylum claims at the border are at a record high, it\u2019s not possible to prove or disprove his argument drawing a direct line between Trump and his policies and the leap in asylum seekers or even the overall surge in migration.\n30: \"It\u2019s always hard to pinpoint the cause of migration flows because there are so many factors that go into these decisions to migrate,\" said Jessica Bolter, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute.\n31: Bolter and other experts described myriad \"push factors\" leading migrants from the Northern Triangle to leave their homes, including gang violence, a precarious economy, pressures from climate change and widespread government corruption.\n32: Meanwhile, brighter economic opportunities in the strong U.S. job market and the chance to reunite with family members now living in the U.S. account for some of the main draws.\n33: Experts also said it is difficult to pinpoint what began attracting asylum seekers in higher numbers this year and last.\n34: \"It\u2019s a little bit of a mystery because it kind of came out of nowhere,\" said Pia Orrenius, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who studies regional economic growth and demographic change.\n35: She said those countries\u2019 economies and job situation have not changed much, and crime, while significant, hasn\u2019t worsened.\n36: Meanwhile, more lenient policies implemented under Mexico\u2019s new president could play a role, she and other experts suggested.\n37: Smugglers may also be capitalizing on the backlogged asylum system, which has allowed many migrants to stay in the U.S. as their cases are processed, some experts said.\n38: That\u2019s another avenue the Trump administration has worked to cut off.\n39: Several experts also suggested Trump\u2019s rhetoric, along with his administration\u2019s moves to discourage immigration, might be driving refugees to the U.S. border by giving smugglers ammunition to persuade families to migrate now before more restrictive policies are implemented.\n40: \"When Trump came in and announced his hardline policy and intention to build a border wall, I think that itself started people heading northward to get in before the wall was built,\" said Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University\u2019s Office of Population Research, who has studied border migration for decades.\n41: \"So I think to some extent Trump actually encouraged the flow with his hardline tactics.\"\n42: However, Massey added, \"there\u2019s no really strong analytic way to show if that\u2019s true or false.\"\n43: On the other hand, Andrew \"Art\" Arthur, a former immimigration judge and an advocate for more restrictive border enforcement, argued that record high asylum claims suggest Congress is at fault for stymying the president\u2019s attempts at reform.\n44: \"It\u2019s not the president\u2019s rhetoric but Congress\u2019 inaction, both with respect to plugging the loopholes and with respect to providing sufficient resources that\u2019s caused this huge influx of people coming to the border,\" said Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower immigration levels.\n45: \"People are taking advantage of the situation and Congress has failed to act.\"\n46: Experts we interviewed also questioned Durbin\u2019s argument that Trump\u2019s move to cut foreign aid is to blame, noting the measure is just beginning to take effect and would have preceded the recent migration surge, which began in late 2018.",

Bush 43 took it from 0 to 1.2 trillion.\"\n33: This is in the ballpark.\n34: Ignoring the fact that he actually started his presidency with a surplus, Bush left office in 2009 with a federal deficit of roughly $1.41 trillion.\n35: \"(Barack) Obama halved it to 600 billion.\"\n36: This is essentially accurate.\n37: Obama left the presidency with a deficit of approximately $584.6 billion, which is more than halving $1.41 trillion.\n38: The deficit was even lower in 2015 at\u00a0around $441.9 billion.\n39: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We had to look for more recent data to back up Cole\u2019s allegation that \"Trump\u2019s got it back to a trillion.\"\n40: A Treasury Department statement from June put the federal deficit at about $747.1 billion so far this fiscal year.\n41: But the agency also reported that Washington is on track to post a $1.1 trillion deficit by the end of September, which backs up Cole\u2019s claim.\n42: After we published this story, some readers asked us to look at the annual deficit in terms of constant dollars, which adjust for inflation.\n43: Data since 1940 show that the deficit was highest in 2009, 2010 and 2011 \u2014 the height of the Great Recession and the aftermath of the 2009 stimulus package.\n44: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Presidential power How much power do presidents have to change the deficit anyway?\n45: The president does affect the budget by negotiating and signing appropriations bills.\n46: But there\u2019s a lot more to it.\n47: First, the country\u2019s economic situation has a big impact on the federal deficit.\n48: The Great Recession affected the deficit near the end of George W. Bush\u2019s administration and the beginning of Obama\u2019s, said Stephen Ellis, executive vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n49: There was more spending on safety net programs like food stamps and Medicaid and less income from taxes.\n50: Second, new presidents take office in January and, for the most part, inherit the budget from the previous administration for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014\u00a0not to mention legislation passed in years prior.\n51: \"Even the \u2018dream budget\u2019 that the president proposes is tied by all sorts of historical obligations and economic conditions,\" Tara Sinclair, an associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University, told PolitiFact.\n52: None of that is to say that the president doesn\u2019t have any effect on the deficit, Ellis said.\n53: He used Reagan\u2019s tax cuts and Obama\u2019s stimulus package as examples of how the president can affect deficit spending.\n54: The combination of spending hikes and tax cuts amplifies deficits.\n55: Trump oversaw both.\n56: While the rise in spending was bi-partisan, the tax cuts were a Republican effort that Trump championed.\n57: In the time since Trump signed his landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, the deficit has increased by more than $100 billion.\n58: A Congressional Budget Office report from April 2018 found that the law could add almost $1.9 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.\n59: But Cole\u2019s tweet still lacks some nuance.",

Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently shepherded a bill to raise the minimum wage through the House of Representatives, saying the wage won\u2019t pay for modest housing.\n1: \"The studies show at the minimum wage today, you can\u2019t rent a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States,\" he told the House Rules Committee on July 15.\n2: \"I\u2019m not talking about San Francisco or New York City, I\u2019m talking about anywhere - a modest two-bedroom apartment.\"\n3: Scott made the claim three times during a five-minute speech to the panel.\n4: We checked if he was right.\n5: A spokesperson for the House Committee on Education and Labor, which Scott chairs, said the congressman was referring to a 2019 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled \" Out of Reach .\"\n6: The report, updated yearly, examines the affordability of housing for minimum wage earners in more than 3,500 counties and metropolitan areas across the country.\n7: The study found, \"In no state, metropolitan area, or county in the U.S. can a worker earning the federal or prevailing state minimum wage afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at fair market rent by working a standard 40-hour work week.\"\n8: There are a few terms we need to break down: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour has been in effect since 2009.\n9: Twenty-one states , including Virginia, use that rate as their minimum wage.\n10: The rest, and the District of Columbia, have set their minimum wage higher.\n11: Scott\u2019s bill , which faces a tough road in the U.S. Senate, would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025.\n12: The prevailing minimum wage is the baseline pay rate that\u2019s in effect in a state or locality.\n13: Twenty-nine states exceed the federal minimum, from $7.50 an\u00a0hour in New Mexico to $12 in California and Washington.\n14: Some cities have minimum wages higher than their states.\n15: The study used the prevailing minimum wage in its computations for each locality.\n16: Fair market rent is the 40th median percentile of rents (including utilities, but not telephone) paid by tenants who have moved in a locality during the last two years.\n17: It\u2019s slightly less than median rent.\n18: It is a term used by the federal government in some housing programs and the bottom rent for what the study calls a \"modest\" home.\n19: The national coalition defines \" affordability \" as consistent\u00a0with a federal standard that no more than 30% of a household\u2019s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities.\n20: That\u2019s the\u00a0guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development .\n21: So, what the study found is that there is no U.S. locality where minimum wage earners, working 40 hours a week, can find a modest two-bedroom home that will rent for 30% or less of their gross income.\n22: In every locality, at least 60% of the two-bedroom units are unaffordable, according to standard housing definitions.\n23: In most places, far more than 60% are beyond their means.\n24: In Virginia, for example, a household would have to work 128 hours a week at the state\u2019s minimum wage - or 3.2 full-time jobs - to afford a two-bedroom home at the 40th rent percentile, according to the report.\n25: That's third highest in the nation, trailing\u00a0 Hawaii (3.6), and New Jersey (3.3).\n26: In Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico, a household would need to work 2.8\u00a0 full-time jobs at minimum wage to afford the apartment.\n27: The study does not say no two-bedroom home would be available to a minimum-wage earner anywhere in the country.\n28: The qualifier \"modest\" home - used in the report and by Scott - is important.\n29: There might be affordable two-bedroom apartment available, but they would be\u00a0below the \"modest\" standard - usually, far below.\n30: What about a one-bedroom home?\n31: A minimum wage earner would find them affordable in 28 counties across the country, or less than 1%\u00a0of the jurisdications, according to the study.\n32: Several housing experts have told PolitiFact National the\u00a0coalition\u2019s report is generally consistent with other housing studies, including a recent reports published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies and Harvard University.\n33: PolitiFact National cited the coalition\u2019s report last year in fact-checking a statement by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., that,\u00a0\"In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can\u2019t afford a 1-bedroom apartment.\"\n34: Her claim was rated Mostly True.\n35: It was slightly downgraded because she didn\u2019t specify the statistic applied to \"modest\" homes.\n36: Scott didn\u2019t make that mistake.",

Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are standing in the way of efforts on Capitol Hill to address gun violence despite widespread public support.\n1: Trump and McConnell, he contended, have stonewalled efforts to expand background check requirements via bipartisan legislation that cleared the Democrat-controlled House more than 200 days ago .\n2: Current federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers; the House bill would require background checks for all firearm purchases.\n3: \"Background checks just make sense,\" Durbin said.\n4: \"Turns out that 90% of policemen are for it, 90% of gun owners are for it, the overwhelming majority of members of the National Rifle Association are for it.\n5: And yet this president and the leader of the Senate refuse to act.\"\n6: PolitiFact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public, along with statements that line up with what Durbin said about gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association widely backing them as well.\n7: But his claim about support among law enforcement wasn\u2019t one we\u2019d heard before, so we decided to check it out.\n8: A spokesperson for Durbin\u2019s office pointed us to results from a survey published in 2017 by Pew Research Center , a generally reliable source for data.\n9: Experts we contacted told us they were not aware of any more recent surveys on the topic.\n10: That survey \u2014 conducted for Pew by the National Police Research Platform, a consortium of researchers headquartered at the University of Illinois at Chicago \u2014 found 88% of police support \"making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.\"\n11: The margin of error for the question was plus or minus two percentage points, according to a Pew spokesperson.\n12: As the survey\u2019s detailed methodology section lays out, interviews were completed online during the summer of 2016 by nearly 8,000 officers from 54 police and sheriff\u2019s departments across the country.\n13: Experts, including at Pew, explained there\u2019s one caveat worth keeping in mind, though.\n14: The survey left out more rural, small-town police forces throughout the country: It provides a nationally representative sample of officers working in departments that employ at least 100 full-time sworn officers, but smaller departments were not included.\n15: \"While 88% appears to be a good estimate for this sampling frame, it may exclude a fraction of the nation\u2019s officers who disproportionately hold more conservative views on gun control issues,\" said polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis.\n16: However, Smith noted, a substantial majority of police nationwide likely work for departments of the size that were included.\n17: Indeed, 63% of all sworn officers work in departments of more than 100 officers, according to Pew.\n18: So the result still speaks for the majority.\n19: To gain some insight into that position, we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks.\n20: \"Most of them want to protect the Constitution,\" said Frank Kaminski, police chief of Park Ridge, Ill. and a former president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.\n21: \"But they also see the violence in the streets every day and realize that we have to take common sense measures to reduce it.\"\n22: \"When we talk about violence, we talk about violence not only to citizens but also to officers,\" he added.",

        "passage": "0: Editor's Note: This item was updated to clarify that firearms dealers are required to fill out and reatain ATF Form 4473 for all types of gun purchases.\n1: Gun control is a contentious topic in Wisconsin\u2019s divided government, with Democratic Gov.\n2: Tony Evers planning to force the issue by calling the Republican-controlled Legislature into a special session .\n3: The debate here and elsewhere typically centers on two types of legislation, both of which have been implemented in many other states: Red flag laws \u2014 These allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from people acting dangerously.\n4: Universal background checks \u2014 These measures require background checks for sales by private parties, in addition to gun dealers, which are already required by federal law.\n5: Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald was asked to weigh in on the topic in a Sept. 22, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s \" UpFront .\"\n6: He said he didn\u2019t see any momentum for red flag laws, then pivoted, unprompted, to the other gun control flashpoint.\n7: \"Universal background checks, too,\" said the Juneau Republican, who recently announced he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n8: \"I mean, any time you\u2019re going to ask somebody to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official, it\u2019s going to violate the Second Amendment.\"\n9: This raises some questions worth examining.\n10: People can disagree on whether universal background checks are a good idea (polling shows most Wisconsinites think so ), but we should at least be able to agree on what they are.\n11: So, do background checks really involve submitting serial numbers to the government?\n12: And would that violate the Second Amendment?\n13: How background checks work Fitzgerald\u2019s office did not reply to our requests for evidence of his claim and more details on his position.\n14: But his response in the TV interview suggests universal background checks are tantamount to a gun registry \u2014 where the government keeps a record of which guns each person owns.\n15: It\u2019s a common argument from opponents of universal background checks, who see it as a step toward confiscation.\n16: But it\u2019s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue.\n17: There\u2019s no, well, universal version of universal background checks, but the basic concept is that private sellers are subject to the same general requirements as licensed gun dealers, including background checks on the would-be purchaser and keeping records of the sale.\n18: Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently do not require background checks or record-keeping on private gun sales.\n19: At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving licensed firearm dealers.\n20: Some states \u2014 including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , a research and advocacy organization.\n21: They call that the \"most comprehensive policy option.\"\n22: Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check.\n23: The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement.\n24: RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order?\n25: In Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun.\n26: The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales , while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems , run by the FBI.\n27: What information is submitted to the government Fitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let\u2019s examine how those could look.\n28: If Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales.\n29: For long gun sales, dealers fill out ATF form 4473 \u2014 which includes the gun make and serial number \u2014 and submit it to the FBI\u2019s criminal background system.\n30: The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours.\n31: The dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years.\n32: After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF.\n33: But federal law forbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them \"to establish any system for the registration of firearms.\"\n34: The records are retained using decades-old microfilm technology , making gun tracing a painstaking, manual process.\n35: For handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\n36: State law requires dealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ.\n37: But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.\n38: So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would \u2014 eventually \u2014 make it to a government agency.\n39: But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database.\n40: If Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government.\n41: For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales.\n42: Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?\n43: All of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald\u2019s claim \u2014 that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment.\n44: Courts have said that isn\u2019t true.\n45: Six states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n46: \"These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual\u2019s Second Amendment rights,\" said Daniel Webster , director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.",

        "passage": "0: During a panel on the border crisis hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, a Republican from Central Texas, answered questions alongside Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S.\n1: Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n2: Williams said he is frustrated when he hears people characterize the situation at the border as a \"homemade crisis\" or a \"made-up crisis.\"\n3: \"We\u2019re doing everything we can do to help these folks, but at the same time, we\u2019ve got to get back to defending our borders and the rule of law,\" Williams said at the August event.\n4: \"I had a meeting with law enforcement in my district and they said, here\u2019s a fact for you \u2014 we\u2019re all familiar with Interstate 35 \u2014 they said 50% of the DUIs on Interstate 35 are from illegals.\n5: Ninety percent of the 50% have absolutely no identification.\n6: So you give them a ticket, you can\u2019t put them in jail because the jails are full here ... so you send them on their way.\"\n7: There are a lot of problems with Williams\u2019 claim.\n8: First of all, he appears to be conflating DUIs and DWIs.\n9: He referenced DUIs, an offense reserved for minors who are found to be operating a motor vehicle with any detectable amount of alcohol in their systems, but then went on to discuss placing offenders in jail.\n10: When minors in Texas are apprehended by law enforcement, they are taken to a juvenile processing office and then, if they are not released to a parent or guardian, to a juvenile detention facility.\n11: Also, his claim that individuals pulled over for DWIs are sent \"on their way\" with a ticket because jails in Texas are full is inaccurate.\n12: Jails across the state are at varying levels of occupancy and have different practices in place to handle capacity issues.\n13: Williams also did not specify which parts of the freeway he was considering and he did not offer a timeframe for his claim.\n14: After speaking with officials at five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewing different records related to arrests and immigration status, it is clear that there is no evidence to support Williams\u2019 claim.\n15: None of the agencies we contacted could provide data to directly inform Williams\u2019 statement.\n16: The information they could share revealed that a small percentage of all arrests for people driving while intoxicated are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.\n17: No official figures on this claim are maintained by law enforcement Interstate 35 is a roughly 1,600-mile freeway that stretches from Laredo at the Texas-Mexico border to Minnesota.\n18: The road runs through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa.\n19: About 504 miles of the freeway are in Texas.\n20: Williams represents the 25th Congressional District , which includes multiple non-connected stretches of the interstate.\n21: In Austin, his district includes more than 3 miles near downtown .\n22: It also includes about 55 miles of Interstate 35 West from Abbott to Burleson and about 9 miles of Interstate 35 East outside of Milford .\n23: John Etue, chief of staff to Williams, said that the numbers came from law enforcement officers within the 25th Congressional District \"regarding their personal experiences while performing their duties within their areas of operation.\"\n24: \"These are not official Texas or DPS stats,\" he said.\n25: Etue declined a request to provide information about the officers who provided the information, including the agency where they work.\n26: I-35 is part of the state highway system and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.\n27: Various law enforcement agencies enforce traffic laws on these roadways, including the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety, which houses the State Highway Patrol.\n28: Local law enforcement officers also enforce traffic laws on portions of the highways that are within their jurisdiction.\n29: We first turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety for its figures on drunken driving arrests on I-35, but a spokesperson said: \"The data you\u2019re requesting is not something the department tracks.\"\n30: Williams said he spoke with officers in the 25th Congressional District, so we turned to four law enforcement agencies with coverage areas that overlap with the portion of I-35 that runs through the district \u2014 the Austin Police Department, the Travis County sheriff\u2019s office, the Hill County sheriff\u2019s office and the Hillsboro Police Department.\n31: In Texas, local officers are allowed \u2014 but not required \u2014 to ask about the immigration status of any individual they detain, including during traffic stops.\n32: Local jails also are required to comply with requests from federal immigration authorities to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally.\n33: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement places detainers on people who have been arrested on criminal charges and \"for whom ICE possesses probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States.\"\n34: When a detainer is placed on an individual, local law enforcement must hold the individual for up to 48 hours, giving ICE agents time to respond and take custody of the individual.\n35: None of the entities we contacted were able to provide the exact information we requested, due to discrepancies in how information is recorded and maintained across agencies.\n36: Open records policies also limit what information can be released about ICE detainers.\n37: Only one agency was able to provide any information about whether individuals arrested for DWIs had identification.\n38: Other data highlights problem with Williams\u2019 claim The Austin Police Department provided figures about all arrests for driving while intoxicated on I-35, but could not provide information about immigration status.\n39: The department has made 3,904 DWI arrests on I-35 from January 2014 through the end of August this year, according to records provided by the department.\n40: The Travis County sheriff\u2019s office tracks people booked into the county jail with DWI arrests who had been flagged by federal immigration authorities, but they do not filter the information by the location of the arrest.\n41: The jail houses individuals arrested across the county by many different law enforcement agencies.\n42: From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests.\n43: Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer.\n44: Also, in Travis County, the court tasked with handling DWI cases had information about DWI arrests and the percentage of people arrested who were from a different country, but court officials were not able to zero in on people here illegally or the location of the arrest.\n45: They also could not provide information on whether an individual had identification or not.\n46: Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens.\n47: It\u2019s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally.\n48: Travis County Attorney David Escamilla, whose office prosecutes misdemeanors like DWIs, said he was not familiar with the figures cited by Williams.\n49: \"I\u2019ve never seen that type of metric and I find it highly improbable,\" Escamilla said.\n50: The Hillsboro Police Department was able to provide information about DWI arrests within its jurisdiction and the number of people arrested who were in the country illegally at the time of the arrest, but they could not limit the arrests by location.\n51: From 2011 through 2019, the department made 180 DWI arrests.\n52: Of those, three people had ICE detainers.\n53: Of those three people, one did not have identification.\n54: Finally, Capt.\n55: Justin Motherspau at the Hill County sheriff\u2019s office said the details in Williams\u2019 claim are \"not something that we even have the ability to track.\"",

Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Trump \u2014\u00a0had learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was officially filed.\n3: The newspaper reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint had approached a committee aide for advice on how to proceed with concerns over Trump\u2019s July phone call with the president of Ukraine.\n4: The article explained how Schiff, D-Calif., knew to press for the release of the whistleblower complaint, which the Trump administration had previously tried to keep from Congress .\n5: The same day that the Times published its report, several right-leaning outlets jumped on the story, claiming it showed the whistleblower \"colluded\" with House Democrats.\n6: During a press conference , Trump claimed Schiff \"probably helped write\" the complaint and called it a hoax.\n7: One Facebook post published the same day took it a step further, alleging Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., worked with lawyers to \"devise the complaint.\"\n8: Another one says , \"Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were participants with attorneys and are complicit in EDITING AND COMPOSING THE \u2018WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT\u2019 BEFORE IT WAS FILED.\"\n9: Those posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n10: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n11: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What we know Schiff \"learned about the outlines\" of the whistleblower complaint from the House Intelligence Committee aide who consulted with the CIA officer, the Times reported.\n12: The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint.\n13: The Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff\u2019s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump.\n14: The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them.\n15: The aide did not share the officer\u2019s identity with Schiff.\n16: The whistleblower\u2019s primary concern centered on the phone call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.\n17: RELATED STORY: Timeline: The Trump impeachment inquiry During that call, a summary of which was released by the White House Sept. 25, Trump asked Zelensky to consider reviving an investigation linked to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden\u2019s son had worked for as a board member while his father was vice president.\n18: That request came after Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n19: The whistleblower reached out to the House Intelligence Committee aide sometime before they filed the official complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community Aug. 12.\n20: Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump on Sept. 24, and Schiff is leading that inquiry.\n21: The Washington Post article said it is not uncommon for the House Intelligence Committee to receive informal inquiries from whistleblowers before a formal complaint is filed, according to \"current and former committee staffers.\"\n22: And the officer took their concerns to the committee only after they had a colleague relay them to the CIA\u2019s top lawyer, which resulted in the CIA alerting the White House.\n23: That spooked the whistleblower into taking their concerns directly to the House, the New York Times reported.\n24: What the whistleblower and Schiff say Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress.\n25: But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff\u2019s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary.\n26: At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint.\n27: We asked the House Intelligence Committee what Schiff learned from the aide about the whistleblower complaint.\n28: A spokesman declined to comment on the particulars of that interaction, but he denied that Schiff had any contact with the whistleblower directly.\n29: \"As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower\u2019s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the (Department of National Intelligence) when the (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) finally provided it to the Committee,\" the committee spokesman said in an email.\n30: RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place We also reached out to Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the CIA officer.\n31: He said he also can\u2019t comment on what Schiff knew about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns, but that the officer \"drafted the complaint entirely on their own.\"\n32: \"In fact, none of the legal team saw the complaint until it was publicly released by Congress,\" Zaid said in an email.\n33: \"To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general.\n34: Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff.\"",

        "passage": "0: Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in September that the House Intelligence Committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filed.\n1: But recent reporting from the New York Times revealed that Schiff, the committee chairman, had indeed learned about the outlines of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns days in advance.\n2: Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, per committee procedures.\n3: The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.\n4: As the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker first noted , this revelation flies in the face of Schiff\u2019s public comments during the month of September, when he dodged questions about whether he or his committee had talked to the whistleblower and, in one case , denied that they had.\n5: On Sept. 17, more than a week before the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was made public, MSNBC\u2019s Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard from the whistleblower and if he wanted to.\n6: \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\" Schiff said .\n7: \"We would like to.\n8: But I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress, and so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation.\"\n9: RELATED: What the whistleblower law says about sharing complaints with Congress The New York Times report, which quoted Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland acknowledging that \"the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance,\" shows that this statement was inaccurate.\n10: While it was not publicly known that Schiff\u2019s committee had communicated with the whistleblower ahead of the complaint\u2019s filing, Schiff knew the truth.\n11: When given the chance to say that the whistleblower had reached out to a committee aide, he did not.\n12: Schiff\u2019s comments The New York Times reported that the committee aide received only a vague outline of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns.\n13: Without revealing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, the aide then told Schiff \"some of what the officer conveyed,\" the report said.\n14: Other outlets reported similar details.\n15: Previously, Schiff had given the impression that his committee never spoke to the whistleblower.\n16: Before Schiff\u2019s MSNBC interview \u2014 in which he flatly stated, \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\" \u2014 Schiff also evaded a question from CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about whether he\u2019d been contacted by the whistleblower or the whistleblower\u2019s legal representation.\n17: \"I don\u2019t want to get into any particulars,\" Schiff said during the Sept. 16 interview.\n18: \"I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.\"\n19: Schiff has since clarified his remarks.\n20: He told the Daily Beast that until recently, he did not know for certain whether the complaint detailing the Trump-Zelensky call was submitted by the same whistleblower who contacted his staff.\n21: He also said he thought the questions asking if the committee had heard from the whistleblower were focused on whether the whistleblower had testified privately in Congress.\n22: \"I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,\"\u00a0 Schiff told the Daily Beast.\n23: \"I regret that I wasn't much more clear.\"\n24: In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee said Schiff\u2019s comments on MSNBC were \"intended to answer the question of whether the committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not.\"\n25: \"Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear,\" the spokesperson said.\n26: Mark Zaid, the whistleblower\u2019s counsel, declined to comment on the whistleblower\u2019s outreach to committee staff but stressed that the whistleblower wrote the complaint \"entirely on their own.\"\n27: We addressed the false claim that Schiff helped write the complaint in a separate fact-check .",

        "passage": "0: Republicans love praising the Trump economy.\n1: With one of the lowest unemployment rates in years and steady job growth, there\u2019s a lot to boast about.\n2: But just how well does the Trump administration\u2019s overall economic performance compare to his predecessor Barack Obama?\n3: And how has the business climate fared under the two presidents?\n4: Here\u2019s what U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed in a July 15, 2019 tweet : \"Republican policies have led to business investment growth that\u2019s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama.\"\n5: The numbers don\u2019t lie, he says.\n6: But how exactly is he measuring them?\n7: Although the tweet is a bit old, the issue will be an important one in the coming election, so we decided to take a look.\n8: The data To come to his conclusion, Johnson\u2019s staff told us he used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that measures economic growth.\n9: Johnson pointed to statistics measuring \"private fixed investment, nonresidential\" which show how much businesses invest in structures, equipment and intellectual property, such as software and research and development.\n10: Johnson broadly said growth has been 10 times faster under Trump than Obama in his tweet.\n11: Those who read it would, presumably think it took in Obama\u2019s entire eight year tenure.\n12: But in the data Johnson used, he only compared the final two years of the Obama administration, 2015 and 2016, to a little over the first two years of data for the Trump administration.\n13: That approach often signals cherry-picking.\n14: Let\u2019s dig deeper.\n15: \"We use the final two years of the Obama administration for comparison because it constitutes a comparable length of time with the two years of data for the Trump administration,\" said Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for Johnson.\n16: \"It is a time adjacent to, rather than remote from, the Trump years.\"\n17: According to Johnson\u2019s data points, Obama had an average of 0.6% growth in that period, compared to 6.4% under Trump.\n18: The Bureau of Economic Analysis updated the data shortly after Johnson made the statement.\n19: In doing so, figures for some of the quarters were slightly adjusted, but the overall trend was largely the same.\n20: The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%.\n21: Meanwhile, between 2017 and 2018 (and the first quarter of 2019), the Trump administration had a growth of about 5.5%.\n22: That\u2019s not far off from the original numbers, though quite not as strong.\n23: The full picture Of course, Obama\u2019s term did not start in 2015.\n24: Under the full eight years of the Obama administration, the rate of business investment growth was about 3.7%.\n25: When bringing Trump\u2019s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%.\n26: So, looking at all of Obama\u2019s tenure, the numbers are much more comparable.\n27: What about the beginning of Obama\u2019s term.\n28: How does it compare to the beginning of Trump\u2019s term?\n29: In Obama\u2019s first two years plus an additional quarter -- the period cited by Johnson -- the business investment rate actually declined by 0.3%.\n30: This was the period immediately after the Great Recession.\n31: That underscores the volatility of the numbers -- and how the timeframe you pick can make a major difference.\n32: Other measures, other factors There are other ways to examine business growth -- and another part of the claim to consider: Johnson asserts the growth was caused by GOP policies.\n33: Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations.\n34: Why?\n35: The nation\u2019s GDP -- a conventional measure of the size of the economy -- has also grown over time.\n36: \"The share of GDP going to \u2018private fixed investment, nonresidential\u2019 is below the peaks seen in the 1980s and 2000s,\" Sinclair said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n37: Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it\u2019s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes.\n38: Indeed, as we have noted time and again in fact checks, experts say it is wrong to attribute too much to individuals or particular policy changes.\n39: There are simply too many factors in the economy to boil it down to one.\n40: \"As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,\" Sinclair told us.",

Facilities, and did not receive any responses to our questions.\n15: However, we did obtain a letter from AEG that cited an estimated $530,000 cost.\n16: Target Center cited a $530,000 cost Hugh Lombardi, AEG Facilities\u2019 general manager, sent a letter to the Trump campaign\u2019s director of advance, Bobby Peede, on Oct. 7.\n17: The letter states: \"The City of Minneapolis has presented a preliminary estimate of additional security and related costs associated with the October 10, 2019 Event at Target Center.\n18: These estimated additional expenses total $530,000.\"\n19: The letter

arrangements are not confirmed by 8 a.m. Oct. 8, then the agreement will be terminated \"for breach of the Event Security provision.\"\n21: The campaign wrote in a letter to AEG that the campaign and AEG are not required to pay for security and threatened to sue.\n22: (We have not seen a copy of the agreement.)\n23: Casper Hill, a city spokesman, told PolitiFact that the public safety costs are expected to be around $400,000 and there are an additional $130,000 costs for lane closure fees and traffic control, among other things.\n24: The city examined the costs for other major recent events to determine the costs, including the Super Bowl in 2018, which was roughly $6 million, and $1.5 million for the Final Four men\u2019s college basketball tournament earlier this year.\n25: Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal told the Star Tribune that \"it\u2019s not fair\" for residents to shoulder the costs.\n26: Segal told the Star Tribune that the city has been having conversations with organizations including the Twins, the Vikings and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority about sharing costs of events.\n27: Those discussions started before the Super Bowl in 2018, she said.\n28: Minneapolis\u2019 estimate, however, appears far higher than what it cost other cities to host Trump rallies.\n29: The Star Tribune reported that Trump\u2019s rally in Rochester in 2018 cost the city government $76,138 while a rally in Duluth cost the city more than $69,000.\n30: A national investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that among local governments that invoiced the Trump campaign, the amounts ranged between $8,000 to $82,000 for public safety costs related to rallies.\n31: The highest bill was from the city of El Paso for about $470,000.\n32: On the day of the 2009 Obama rally, the Minneapolis police chief estimated the department\u2019s costs to top $20,000 including for 50 officers on overtime at the 20,500-seat Target Center arena, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported.\n33: We tried to confirm if that was the actual cost with police officials but did not get a response.\n34: It isn\u2019t unusual for local law enforcement agencies to be asked to swallow security costs, and Trump\u2019s is not the only campaign to do so.\n35: The Center for Public Integrity found that Obama\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always pay for security.\n36: Some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't respond to the Center when asked about security bills while others said they will pay or had paid certain bills.\n37: No FEC requirement for candidates to pay security There is no specific requirement within the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act or Federal Election Commission regulations for congressional or presidential campaign committees to pay for expenses incurred by a state or local government for campaign events, said Myles Martin, an FEC spokesman.\n38: That means that campaigns can choose to reimburse governments for security costs, but they are not required.\n39: A Secret Service spokesman told PolitiFact that it is not funded to pay police overtime and doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to do so.\n40: \"This is a blank spot in campaign finance laws and campaigns often take advantage of it, as the Trump campaign is in Minneapolis this week,\" said Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier.\n41: \"It's a low priority for Congress because it does not affect legislators' campaigns in a significant way.\"\n42: There is, however, a mechanism for local law enforcement to seek reimbursement for protecting Trump\u2019s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey .",

        "passage": "0: President Donald Trump is doubling down on a photo he says shows Joe Biden and his son posing with a Ukrainian gas executive as evidence Biden knows more than he has let on.\n1: \"The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple!\n2: The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,\" he tweeted .\n3: \"Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.\"\n4: The photo, which was first aired by Fox News on Sept. 30, shows Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf in the Hamptons in 2014.\n5: According to Trump, one of the men is the \"company boss\" of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter served as a board member while his father was vice president.\n6: Trump tweeted a doctored Nickelback music video Oct. 2 that includes the image juxtaposed with an interview in which Joe Biden says he had never talked to his son about his business dealings abroad.\n7: That video was quickly removed from both Twitter and YouTube due to a potential copyright infringement for the Nickelback music.\n8: But now Trump is re-upping the claim amid an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him for his own dealings with Ukraine.\n9: We reached out to the White House for more information about the source of Trump\u2019s claim, but they did not comment on the record.\n10: Trump\u2019s tweet is misleading on two fronts.\n11: \u2022 The photo shows the Bidens with another American board member of Burisma.\n12: \u2022 Biden hasn\u2019t said whether or not he\u2019s spoken with Burisma officials.\n13: Who\u2019s really in the photo Trump claimed that the photo of the Bidens shows them posing \"with the company boss\" of Burisma.\n14: Our research shows otherwise.\n15: In a previous story , we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer.\n16: In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer \u2014 a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 \u2014 in a string of investment and consulting firms.\n17: The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members.\n18: That role is different from \"boss\" or \"executive,\" as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer.\n19: Board members are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of a company.\n20: While Joe Biden was vice president, firms run by his son and Archer \"pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\" the New York Times reported in May.\n21: The fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm.\n22: He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014.\n23: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshots from Twitter and Netrex) We reached out to Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign for more details, but they did not comment on the record.\n24: Taras Burdeinyi is the current CEO of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky is the founder and owner.\n25: In 2014, Alan Apter was the chairman of the board of directors and reportedly brought on Biden and Archer.\n26: What Biden said In his tweet, Trump claimed that Joe Biden said he \"never spoke to the Ukrainian company\" where his son served as a paid board member.\n27: But that mischaracterizes what the Democratic presidential candidate actually said.\n28: In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had \"never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group.\n29: That\u2019s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma.\n30: RELATED STORY: Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, a whistleblower and the Bidens: What we know, what we don\u2019t Biden knew his son worked for the Ukrainian energy company.\n31: Beyond that, there\u2019s little we know.\n32: Hunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015.\n33: The Biden campaign says the discussion was not substantive.",

        "passage": "0: After House Democrats moved forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, a photo of a woman shaking hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated as supposed evidence of Pelosi\u2019s own connections with Ukraine elite.\n1: In reality, the rumor is an attempt to smear Pelosi\u00a0using an American college student only because she was an intern of Pelosi's for a semester and is of Ukrainian descent.\n2: The photo, shared here Oct. 1 , has appeared all over social media with text around it that says: \"Nancy Pelosi\u2019s\u00a0legislative aide, Ivanna Voronovych, is from the Ukraine and is connected to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life \u2026 How did this Ukrainian get cleared to work in the office of the person third in line to the U.S.\n3: presidency?\"\n4: Another image laid over the photo in the upper left hand corner shows a man and a woman along with more text that says, \"Patriarch Filaret Head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\" and \"Mom\u2019s Ukraine Order of Merit for Military & Political Activity.\"\n5: The posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n7: This claim is inaccurate.\n8: PolitiFact found that Ivanna Voronovych did serve as an intern in Pelosi\u2019s district-focused office in Washington, D.C., for a college semester, but did not (and does not currently) work for Pelosi as an aide, nor does she hold any other position in Pelosi\u2019s office.\n9: (Also, the Speaker of the House is second in line to the presidency not the third, as the post states.)\n10: The rumor appears to have originated with a Sept. 30, 2019, story by right-leaning website the Gateway Pundit.\n11: That story says Voronovych \"started her career working at the US Embassy in the Ukraine in Kiev\" and that \"she worked for Roman Woronowycz, the Kiev Bureau Chief, who is connected to Nancy Pelosi.\"\n12: It goes on to claim that, \"Voronovych\u2019s parents are well connected.\n13: Her mom worked with the Ukrainian Army, and even received the Ukraine Order of Merit for military and political activity.\n14: Yoronovych\u2019s [sic] father worked in the Ukrainian Foreign Service and he\u2019s also connected to the Ukrainian government.\"\n15: Something to note: Roman Woronowycz is Voronovych\u2019s father and is not listed as the bureau chief for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, though he does work at the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kiev, according to an agency spokesperson.\n16: PolitiFact reached out to Voronovych about the rumors.\n17: She responded by email, explaining that she is a U.S. citizen and has lived in Ukraine as well as other countries due to her father\u2019s employment with USAID.\n18: She said that she interned for Pelosi in the spring of 2018 while a sophomore at Northeastern University in Boston and when Pelosi was the House minority leader.\n19: Voronovych said her father is a Michigan native and is not chief of the Kiev bureau of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, as the post states.\n20: Voronovych is now a senior at the University of Michigan, where, as a transfer student, she is studying political science and philosophy.\n21: \"Since finishing my internship I have not had any contact with the Speaker, as I imagine she is occupied with more important things than keeping tabs on her previous interns,\" Voronovych said.\n22: She said she has spent the last five years working as a summer hire at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine but never worked with the Ukraininan Embassy in the United States or elsewhere.\n23: \"I have no ties to the Ukrainian government or military outside of the work that I did while employed with the State Department.\"\n24: Ivanna Voronovych\u2019s mother, Viktoria Voronovych, is a Ukrainian-born American citizen and co-founder of the nonprofit International Alliance for Fraternal Assistance, which has helped raise money to deliver medical supplies, gear, equipment and other items to Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russia-backed rebels, according to an interview she gave in 2015 to the Macomb Daily, a newspaper in Detroit.\n25: The photo in the upper-left corner of the viral Facebook post shows Viktoria Voronovych receiving a medal from the patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for her conflict zone volunteer work, according to Ivanna Voronovych, who also sent PolitiFact an image of the medal, which indicates it was presented in 2015.\n26: Ivanna Voronovych said that the organization, which appears to be based in Kiev , raised money from other Ukrainians now living in the United States, most notably Michigan, Illinois and North Carolina.\n27: These days, Ivanna Voronovych said, her mother\u2019s work involves supporting people with disabilities sustained either at birth or by way of involvement in the conflict.\n28: \"This story is a hoax and an outlandish compilation of twisted lies,\" Voronovych said.\n29: \"I have received disturbing messages from people that choose to believe this disinformation, making me feel unsafe and as a possible target.\n30: The comments under some of the Facebook posts alone are enough to make one worry.\n31: I am a private citizen and should not be subject to such an invasion of privacy, libel and defamation of my character.\"\n32: On Oct. 3, Woronowycz also posted a response to the rumors surrounding his daughter on his Facebook page , saying she is an American citizen who interned with Pelosi while also working at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during summers.\n33: He wrote that the rumors have even resulted in death threats: \"My daughter, Ivanna Voronovych, was hit hard two days ago by bots with stories that contain outright lies and twisted facts.\n34: She is an American citizen, an honors student and a social activist who also interned with Speaker Pelosi, while also working at the US Embassy in Ukraine during summers.\n35: She has no connections to the Ukrainian military or the Ukrainian Embassy.\n36: Dozens of pieces by fly-by-night sites are sharing these gross and dangerous lies.\n37: The results have been death threats and lurid comments made by obviously deranged, heartless, soul less, and morally empty a*******.\n38: No one deserves this.\"\n39: Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, confirmed to PolitiFact that Voronovych was an intern in Pelosi\u2019s personal office in Washington, which works solely on representational issues for Pelosi\u2019s congressional district, the 12th District of California.\n40: \"This individual was an intern in our personal office (meaning CA-12 not leadership office).\n41: She was an unpaid intern in the spring of 2018 who answered phones and performed other administrative duties,\" Hammill wrote in an email.\n42: \"The Speaker takes a photo with every intern during their time in Washington.\"\n43: On May 31, 2018, in that same time period, Voronovych posted the photo of herself shaking hands with with Pelosi on her own Facebook page.",

Coincidence?\n10: No.\"\n11: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to Murphy for the source of his post, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n12: Several conservative publications had reported on the allegations about Pelosi\u2019s son, Paul, days before Murphy made that assertion.\n13: We looked into the business dealings of Pelosi, Romney and Kerry\u2019s sons.\n14: Claims about Pelosi\u2019s son are misleading Paul Pelosi Jr. once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name.\n15: But Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity, and it\u2019s unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine.\n16: Reports of the connection appeared in One America News Network and other conservative outlets, the source of which appears to be an Oct. 3 tweet from Patrick Howley, a writer for The Epoch Times.\n17: The pro-Donald Trump website has been known to publish conspiratorial content.\n18: \"BOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE!\"\n19: Howley said in the tweet, which has been retweeted more than 12,000 times.\n20: \"And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!\"\n21: As evidence, Howley linked to two YouTube videos published March 5, 2013.\n22: The first shows Paul Pelosi speaking at an event in Washington.\n23: The video opens with clips of a speech from Nancy Pelosi and then shows Paul at an XPRIZE Foundation competition in September 2010.\n24: The nonprofit group organizes public competitions with businesses to encourage their technological development.\n25: RELATED

future,\" he says during the video.\n26: Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010.\n27: An old version of the company's website said the company was created to \"engage in research and in the commercial development of hydrocarbon production methods and technologies.\"\n28: After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into\u00a0NRGLab, a Singapore-based company \"specializing in different areas of scientific research.\"\n29: It appears to have published the YouTube videos.\n30: The second video Howley posted shows Walter Afanasieff, a Brazilian-American musician, talking about how technology could improve oil extraction.\n31: The caption lists other artists that had promoted Viscoil\u2019s work, including Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer and actress.\n32: \"Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,\" the caption reads.\n33: An SH-box is a kind of environmentally friendly generator, according to NRGLab .\n34: We found a Facebook page on which Newton has promoted NRGLab\u2019s work, but we could find no news coverage about the company's dealings in Ukraine.\n35: NRGLab does not mention the country on its website.\n36: We reached out to the company for more information but did not get a response.\n37: To sum it up: Paul Pelosi served on the board of Viscoil.\n38: At one point, a Ukrainian singer is alleged to have promoted the company.\n39: But Pelosi was off the board before that happened.\n40: That\u2019s the connection people have identified.\n41: Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact that Paul Pelosi worked for Viscoil for a short time.\n42: He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine at the time.\n43: \"The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,\" he said in an email.\n44: \"The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\"\n45: What we know about the other lawmakers\u2019 sons Hunter Biden did serve as a board member for a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019.\n46: As for the sons of Kerry and Romney, there is no evidence to suggest that they ever held similar positions.\n47: Burisma Holdings appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors in 2014 to help the energy company improve its corporate governance and adopt Western-style transparency.\n48: His father, the former vice president and Democratic candidate running for president in 2020, has faced criticism for the appointment over a conflict of interest.\n49: Kerry has three stepsons from his marriage with Teresa Heinz, heiress to the H.J.\n50: Heinz ketchup fortune: John IV, Andr\u00e9 and Chris.\n51: John is an educator, while Andr\u00e9 is an environmentalist.\n52: RELATED STORY: Ask PolitiFact: Answers to reader questions about the Trump impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden Chris is a businessman with extensive experience in private equity and venture capital \u2014 including pursuing a string of investment and consulting firms with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, another businessman who was Chris Heinz\u2019s roommate at Yale University.\n53: He co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners , a Washington investment fund, in 2009 with Biden and Archer.\n54: Biden and Archer would later serve on the board of Burisma, but Chris Heinz never did.\n55: In fact, he advised Archer against joining the board and, when both he and Hunter didn\u2019t heed the warning, Heinz ended his business relationships with them.\n56: \"Chris has never been on the board of any energy company; nor has he ever traveled to or worked in Ukraine,\" a spokesman for John Kerry told PolitiFact in an email.\n57: All the Heinz children are board members of the Heinz Endowments, the philanthropic arm of their family\u2019s estate, but we could find no evidence that any have served on the board of an energy company linked to Ukraine.\n58: Romney has five sons who work in a variety of different fields: Tagg, Matt, Craig, Josh and Ben.\n59: We could find no evidence that any of them have served on the board of an energy company with ties to Ukraine.\n60: Tagg Romney runs a private equity firm called Solamere Capital.\n61: Matt Romney runs a firm called Excel Trust, which owns shopping centers across the United States.\n62: Craig Romney works in real estate .\n63: Josh Romney is the founder and president of The Romney Group , a real estate company based in Salt Lake City.\n64: Ben Romney is a radiologist in Utah.\n65: We reached out to a spokeswoman for Romney for more details about his sons\u2019 business dealings, but she declined to comment on the substance of the Facebook posts.\n66: \"We don\u2019t comment on fake news from

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.\n1: The release said the proposed rule \"would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don\u2019t need it.\"\n2: What does that mean, exactly?\n3: Here\u2019s how U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, framed it when backing the plan in an Oct. 2, 2019 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel : \"A lot of people didn\u2019t know that millionaires are eligible for food stamps,\" he said.\n4: \"I\u2019m glad Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.\"\n5: The article noted nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose food benefits under the proposed changes.\n6: The state would also have to upgrade its computer systems, retrain workers and make other changes that would cost millions of dollars a year.\n7: But let\u2019s return to Grothman\u00a0and his claim.\n8: Is he right that millionaires are eligible for food stamps?\n9: Let\u2019s take a look.\n10: How the program works According to the Journal Sentinel article: Nearly 40 million people, including about 644,000 Wisconsinites, received food stamps in 2018.\n11: Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to people who qualify for other government programs without performing additional income and asset tests.\n12: The proposed rule would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps.\n13: Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250.\n14: For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month.\n15: Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people.\n16: As the Journal Sentinel article noted: In Wisconsin, about 39,600 people in about 24,100 households would lose more than $11 million in benefits a year, according to estimates from the state Department of Health Services.\n17: Of those, about 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are senior citizens.\n18: So, where do the millionaires come in?\n19: The back door, apparently.\n20: The evidence When asked to provide backup, Grothman\u2019s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010.\n21: \"Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,\" the Examiner article said.\n22: That story has been making the rounds for a while.\n23: In 2011, ABC News reported on the Fick case with a headline that asked: \"How can a man who won millions in the lottery still use food stamps?\"\n24: At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income.\n25: The state considered Fick\u2019s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income.\n26: So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps.\n27: The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program.\n28: That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls.\n29: According to a Congressional Research Service report on the SNAP program, as of October 2018, 34 states -- Wisconsin among them -- that do not check the assets of people applying for food stamps.\n30: In announcing the proposed rule changes, there was no mention of lottery winners, but USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue referred to the case of a well-off Minnesota man, retired engineer Rob Undersander, who signed up for food stamps to prove a point.\n31: In a Sept. 28, 2016 opinion piece for The St.\n32: Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that \"exceeds $1 million.\"\n33: In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps.\n34: So he filled out an application for food stamps in June 2016.\n35: He said he was up front about his assets.\n36: Undersander said he gave the money he received to charity When his case was described at a June 20, 2019 House agriculture subcommittee , the story ignited a partisan firestorm.\n37: Democratic lawmakers accused Undersander of \" defrauding the government with a ridiculous millionaire stunt.\"\n38: Republicans hailed Undersander for \"exposing the flaws of a failed system.\"\n39: The Wisconsin picture In a Sept. 23, 2019 letter to Perdue, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and 14 other Senate Democrats urged the Trump administration to withdraw the proposal.\n40: The letter cited the negative consequences of the rule and argued the administration has not conducted an accurate analysis of its impact on children and families.\n41: Other Democratic officials, including Gov.\n42: Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul are also opposed to the change.\n43: \"The bottom line is you\u2019d have more cost on bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to Wisconsinites,\" Kaul said in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\n44: To be sure, the reduced threshhold would not apply just to millionaires.\n45: It would also apply to people who make just a dollar a year more than the current guidelines -- folks who are far from wealthy.\n46: Grothman\u00a0is standing behind the proposal.\n47: \"It\u2019s obviously frustrating for people living paycheck to paycheck to know that the person ahead of them in line using FoodShare may have $200,000 in the bank,\" Grothman\u00a0told PolitiFact Wisconsin.",

        "passage": "0: While defending Chicago\u2019s offer to the union representing the city\u2019s public school teachers, Mayor Lori Lightfoot claimed it would provide them with a generous salary increase \u2014 on top of an already high payscale.\n1: At a town hall Lightfoot held last month , a high school student told the mayor students need teachers to be paid well, emphasizing the role they play in students\u2019 lives.\n2: \"I agree with you 100% that teachers are important,\" Lightfoot responded.\n3: \"Teachers do need to be paid well, and in Chicago, they are.\n4: Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.\"\n5: The city\u2019s offer to increase teacher pay by 16% over five years, Lightfoot added, is \"a good deal.\"\n6: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The city\u2019s last contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June, and the district\u2019s 25,000 teachers and support staff have set an Oct. 17 strike date if a deal isn\u2019t hammered out by then.\n7: Is Lightfoot correct that teachers in Chicago are already among the nation\u2019s highest paid?\n8: We decided to find out.\n9: A dearth of data Under the most recent contract , the district\u2019s base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree is just under $53,000.\n10: The maximum salary a teacher can earn in CPS after years of experience and with higher credentials is a little more than $101,000.\n11: That\u2019s before the value of required annual pension contributions the district makes on a teacher\u2019s behalf.\n12: In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Lightfoot\u2019s office provided a spreadsheet comparing CPS teacher salaries at different levels in their careers with those in districts in the nation\u2019s 10 other largest cities, and pointed us to some state-level salary data.\n13: But Lightfoot didn\u2019t limit her comparison to what teachers make in other large cities, so we went looking for more comprehensive data to assess her sweeping claim.\n14: None of the sources we found allow for a direct comparison of overall teacher compensation \u2014 not just salary, but pension and health care benefits \u2014 across all districts nationally.\n15: However, figures compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality , a nonpartisan policy and research center, make it possible to compare teacher salaries at various levels of education and experience among the nation\u2019s 124 largest districts.\n16: During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary.\n17: The survey adjusted for cost of living using a measure developed by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n18: Chicago\u2019s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center\u2019s analysis.\n19: For example, a teacher with a master\u2019s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago\u2019s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group\u2019s database.\n20: Even so, Lightfoot didn\u2019t constrain her remarks to the nation\u2019s 100-plus largest districts either.\n21: And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives.\n22: \"A salary schedule really doesn\u2019t tell you what the reality is on the ground,\" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn\u2019t say how many teachers are actually making that pay.\n23: \"It says contractually, this is where people would be if they\u2019re at this level.\"\n24: So we turned to data obtained by the Better Government Association through an open records request to the Illinois State Board of Education to see how Chicago stacked up within state lines.\n25: (The Better Government Association runs PolitiFact Illinois.)\n26: The short answer: Not so well.\n27: Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state\u2019s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone.\n28: Including bonuses, health and pension benefits, its ranking rose somewhat.\n29: But it still trailed 34 other districts , many of them located in the more affluent suburbs outside Chicago and in the surrounding collar counties.\n30: Ben Ost, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us it\u2019s likely CPS trails districts in similar suburbs throughout the nation as well.",

Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.\"\n29: \"All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,\" Anders \u00c5slund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact.\n30: \"Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.\"\n31: Shokin did inherit some of the investigations into Burisma and owner Zlochevsky.\n32: Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster.\n33: But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant.\n34: Kasko said the matter was \"shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,\" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account.\n35: The Trump campaign pointed to reporting by the New York Times that Yuriy Lutsenko, a subsequent prosecutor general, had cleared Burisma initially but then reopened the investigation in March.\n36: At the very least, Shokin's credibility in discussing the case has been undercut by other evidence and the widespread descriptions of his office as uninterested in prosecuting corruption cases.\n37: Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry The ad says that \"Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.\"\n38: The ad soft-pedals Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 by describing it merely as a discussion.\n39: The ad omits that a summary of the call shows Trump encouraging Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr and \"look into\" Biden.\n40: Before the call, Trump froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine.\n41: The hold on the money was lifted Sept. 11.\n42: Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would move forward with an impeachment inquiry in September.\n43: Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent.\n44: They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to discredit the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump and Ukraine prompted House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry by attacking the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers.\n1: Trump once asserted that former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was headed by \"hardened Democrats\" and \"big Crooked Hillary supporters.\"\n2: Now he\u2019s claiming the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys are \"big Democrat(s)\" driven by politics and out to get him.\n3: On Oct. 3, Trump tweeted a clip of conservative commentator Mark Levin on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s primetime TV show.\n4: Levin claimed, without evidence, that the whistleblower hired \"left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding one\u00a0of them.\"\n5: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com \"He happens to get a Schumer-Clinton lawyer, who happens to work with a group called Whistleblower Aid,\" Levin said in the video .\n6: \"And Breitbart has a great piece on this.\n7: They were founded in 2017 for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration.\"\n8: We reviewed voter registration information, campaign finance filings and LinkedIn profiles for each of the whistleblower\u2019s three lawyers, who did not respond to requests for comment.\n9: We found little evidence that they are \"left-wing lawyers\" working for \"left-wing firms,\" and no evidence whatsoever that their work is being funded by George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.\n10: Who are the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys?\n11: The whistleblower is represented by Compass Rose Legal Group , a Washington law firm focused on security clearance, federal employment and national security issues.\n12: The firm\u2019s three attorneys \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj, Mark S. Zaid and I. Charles McCullough III \u2014 have represented the whistleblower \"from the outset,\" according to a statement .\n13: (McCullough has not signed on to more recent statements .)\n14: Bakaj , the lead attorney, is a former intelligence officer and criminal investigator who was himself a whistleblower while working for the CIA inspector general, according to the Washingtonian .\n15: Meanwhile, Zaid runs his own national security law firm .\n16: McCullough is a longtime government official who most recently served as the first ever intelligence community inspector general, working under the director of national intelligence from 2011 to 2017.\n17: Are they liberals?\n18: We checked public records from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n19: Currently, Bakaj is registered to vote in D.C. with no political affiliation, Zaid is registered in Maryland with no political affiliation, and McCullough is registered in Maryland as a Republican.\n20: So where did Levin, Trump and others get the idea that they are \"left-wing\" lawyers?\n21: Levin did not respond to our requests for comment, but his claims that the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers lean to the left can be largely traced to reports from conservative news outlets such as Breitbart and the Washington Free Beacon.\n22: On Sept. 24, Breitbart reported that Bakaj\u2019s \"resume includes work for\" former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n23: The following day, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Bakaj donated this year to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.\n24: The same outlets have also drawn attention to tweets Bakaj and Zaid have posted about Trump, in which they have poked fun at Trump , questioned his fitness for office , urged officials to blow the whistle on government misconduct and offered lower rates for would-be whistleblowers.\n25: It\u2019s true that Bakaj donated to Biden.\n26: According to filings with the Federal Election Commission , he gave $100 to the Biden campaign on April 26.\n27: The Breitbart story leaves out that Bakaj worked as an intern, not as a staffer, for Clinton, Schumer and the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n28: Bakaj was not on their full-time staffs, nor did he represent them as a lawyer.\n29: In response to a related critique from Fox New host Laura Ingraham, Zaid dismissed Bakaj\u2019s internships on Twitter.\n30: \"Andrew \u2014 when he was 19/20 & in college \u2014 interned w/ Senators Schumer & Clinton,\" Zaid wrote .\n31: \"Almost 20 years ago.\"\n32: Zaid donated to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee between 2005 and 2014.\n33: In an interview with The Hill , Zaid said the donations were silent auction biddings that he made as a guest at the committee\u2019s spring ball.\n34: We could not find record of any individual donations from McCullough.\n35: On Twitter , Zaid listed a number of times when he has represented conservatives.\n36: He twice represented GOP members of Congress on cases related to the Freedom of Information Act, and he has represented the Republican National Committee as well.\n37: He also represented five CIA whistleblowers in the Benghazi case, and he represented the Daily Caller , a conservative publication.\n38: \"The partisans are trying to smear the legal team as some liberal opposition,\" Zaid wrote .\n39: \"We are anything but that.\"\n40: The Hill quoted two colleagues of Zaid saying he\u2019s hardly political.\n41: As far as we could tell, Bakaj has not made any similar public statements.\n42: Levin\u2019s other allegations Levin also claimed that Whistleblower Aid , a nonprofit legal group that supports whistleblowers, was created \"for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration.\"\n43: Zaid and Bakaj are affiliated with the group, which set up a GoFundMe to help pay for the whistleblower\u2019s services.\n44: Support for Levin\u2019s claim seems to come from Breitbart , which noted that an old version of the group\u2019s website said \"our Republic is under threat.\"\n45: But aside from that now-deleted language and the fact that the group was founded in 2017, during Trump\u2019s presidency, there\u2019s no evidence that the group is targeting Trump.\n46: When it was created, founder John Tye explicitly said it was \"not a partisan effort.\"\n47: The claim that Soros is involved is more far-fetched.\n48: A Breitbart article mentions Soros numerous times, but each alleged link shows the billionaire several degrees of separation away from the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers.\n49: We could not find any credible evidence connecting Soros to the whistleblower\u2019s efforts.",

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\n1: In the Sept. 9 Facebook post, Manchin wrote, the \"West Virginia Department of Education reported over 10,000 children & youth have been identified as homeless for the 2018-2019 school year.\n2: That's disturbing news, and that's why I invited U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to come to #WV and see the impact this is having on our children & schools.\"\n3: The post proceeded to link to a news release outlining his request to DeVos.\n4: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is Manchin correct about the scale of the K-12 homelessness problem?\n5: Official data from the state education department shows that Manchin is correct -- and that the problem is getting worse.\n6: The number of homeless students has risen since the 2014-15 school year from 8,959 to 10,522 in the 2018-19 school year -- a 17% increase.\n7: Making the increase even more striking, the state\u2019s overall population has actually fallen by almost 2% during that period.\n8: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com It\u2019s worth noting that the statistic uses a federal definition known as McKinney-Vento , which counts students as homeless if they live in shelters, hotels or motels, cars, RVs, or with another family member away from their primary residence.\n9: Students who are in foster care are not included in these numbers.\n10: Why is West Virginia seeing an increase?\n11: Rebecca Derenge, the state official responsible for tracking homeless students, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the opioid epidemic and floods three years ago may have disrupted family situations for some West Virginia residents.\n12: As it happens, this statistic had already caused some controversy in West Virginia by the time Manchin wrote his post.\n13: Initially, the statistic for homeless students was left unmentioned during a major battle over education legislation, and it only came to light after reporting published July 20 by Amelia Ferrell Knisely of the Charleston Gazette-Mail.\n14: The Gazette-Mail reported that \"several lawmakers admitted the thousands of homeless students weren\u2019t mentioned in months of debate leading up to the final vote\" on a major education bill.\n15: Republican state Sen. Patricia Rucker, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, told the newspaper that the homeless-student statistic was never mentioned by school officials or the state education department.\n16: Then, after the statistic came to light, state schools superintendent Steven Paine told West Virginia Board of Education members that, while the number is \"staggering,\" its rise over the years \"was not a significant increase,\" the Gazette-Mail reported Aug. 16.\n17: Paine later apologized for the comment, the Associated Press reported , issuing a statement that he \"in no way intended to convey that the data was not significant.\"",

        "passage": "0: U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, tried his hand at fact-checking in a tweet that suggested a news report from The Associated Press inaccurately characterized the state of income inequality in the United States.\n1: His post \u2014 which caught our attention due to his unauthorized use of a PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter image \u2014 started by summarizing the findings of the news article: \"Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years.\"\n2: \"FACT: Just the opposite,\" Brady wrote.\n3: \"In new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.\"\n4: We had to ask: Who is right?\n5: Is the United States experiencing the highest levels of income inequality in the past 50 years, or do the latest figures show a decline in inequality?\n6: News reports describe growing inequality Let\u2019s start with The Associated Press article, which was published upon the release of new income information from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey at the end of September.\n7: \"The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality,\" the story reads, attributing the information to the Census Bureau.\n8: The article goes on to discuss a change to the Gini Index \u2014 a common summary measure of income inequality.\n9: The value ranges from 0 (perfect equality, when everyone receives an equal share) to 1 (perfect inequality, when one group or recipient receives all the income).\n10: In 2018, the American Community Survey put the Gini Index at 0.485, a statistically significant increase from 2017, when the Gini Index was estimated to be 0.482.\n11: Multiple news outlets wrote articles about the new data released by the Census Bureau, including The Washington Post.\n12: \"Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago, according to data released Thursday, even as the nation\u2019s poverty and unemployment rates are at historic lows,\" the Post article reads.\n13: National Public Radio reported that the \"gap between the richest and the poorest U.S. households is now the largest it\u2019s been in the past 50 years.\"\n14: In the Census Bureau\u2019s press release announcing the latest survey, the agency said income inequality in 2018 was \"significantly higher\" than in 2017.\n15: So, how is it possible that Brady came to a different conclusion about the status of income inequality in the U.S. after reviewing Census Bureau data?\n16: \"The most obvious thing going on is that they are talking about two different data sources,\" said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center who studies trends in income and wealth.\n17: Two surveys have different results Isabelle Gwozdz, a spokeswoman for Brady, said his claim was based on the latest report of the Current Population Survey released by the Census Bureau in September.\n18: The Current Population Survey is a joint effort between the Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to track statistics on employment, earnings and education across the country.\n19: It is a different project than the American Community Survey, which has a significantly larger sample size and collects information on population, housing and other topics \u2014 including income.\n20: Kochhar said the Current Population Survey should be \"understood as a national survey,\" while the American Community Survey \"is designed for measurement across states, metro areas and counties.\"\n21: \"The two surveys are different in methodology, sample size, and reporting period, so it\u2019s not unusual for them to report slightly different findings,\" said David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.\n22: A key difference between the surveys is that the Current Population Survey asks more detailed questions about income than the American Community Survey.\n23: Plus, the Current Population Survey uses a smaller sample size.\n24: For analyzing national income estimates, the Census Bureau generally recommends using the Current Population Survey over the American Community Survey, according to a statement from the agency.\n25: While the Current Population Survey can show changes in income inequality over longer periods of time, \"it is relatively rare for year-to-year changes in the Gini to be statistically significant,\" due to the small sample size of the survey, according to the statement.\n26: The Current Population Survey also uses the Gini Index, as well as three other summary measures of inequality \u2014 Theil, Atkinson and Mean Logarithmic Deviation \u2014 while the American Community Survey only includes Gini.\n27: \"However, they are also difficult to interpret, whereas the Gini has a more straightforward interpretation,\" reads the statement from the Census Bureau.\n28: \"The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of inequality.\"\n29: The value for Gini can vary, depending on the survey and other factors.\n30: Gwozdz said when Brady referenced \"four measures of income inequality,\" he was looking at values for Gini, Theil, Atkinson and the Mean Logarithmic Deviation from the Current Population Survey report on 2018 Income and Poverty .\n31: The Current Population Survey report uses two different \"income concepts\" to measure inequality: money income and equivalence-adjusted income .\n32: Money income is household income, while equivalence-adjusted income considers the number of people in a household and how they might share resources.\n33: Looking just at money income, all four summary measures appeared to show declining inequality from 2017 to 2018.\n34: But none of the decreases is considered statistically significant.\n35: \"If I go to the CPS estimate for 2018, it is no different than the estimate for 2017, statistically speaking,\" Kochhar said.\n36: \"It did decrease, but it was not enough to be statistically significant.\n37: All you can say from CPS is that there was no change between 2017 and 2018.\"\n38: The Census Bureau analyzed changes to the Gini Index in the Current Population Survey report and said that, from that data, \"we cannot say with confidence whether the Gini increased slightly, decreased slightly, or was relatively unchanged.\"\n39: Looking at equivalence-adjusted income, all four measures decreased from 2017 to 2018.\n40: Three of the measures, not including the Mean logarithmic deviation, saw a statistically significant decrease.\n41: The Census Bureau and economics experts we consulted for this fact-check said it is normal to see variations in these measurements, depending on the source of the data and the income concept used for the estimate.\n42: Ken-Hou Lin, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that both The Associated Press and Brady should be more cautious with their interpretations of the Census Bureau data.\n43: \"In general, there\u2019s never a large year-to-year change in inequality,\" he said.\n44: \"Thus, it is difficult to separate the real trend from statistical noise.\"\n45: Kochhar agreed, and said looking at incremental changes to income inequality does not tell the whole story.\n46: \"I would conclude that, in the times we currently are, income inequality is higher than it has been in five decades,\" Kochhar said.\n47: \"Whether this year is different than last year, that is one slice out of the five decades.\"\n48: Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute offered a similar assessment.\n49: \"Bottom line: The AP story is accurate,\" Cooper said. \"\n50: None of the statistics that Mr. Brady cites disprove anything that the AP story reports.\"",

        "passage": "0: U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., explained her support for a \"Medicare for All\" single-payer health care proposal with criticism of the U.S. tax system, saying it is too generous to the richest Americans.\n1: \"Let these facts sink in: The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else,\" Omar tweeted Oct. 12.\n2: \"27 million Americans don\u2019t have health insurance.\n3: We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll .\n4: Let\u2019s get it done when we get back to Washington.\"\n5: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Omar is right about the number of uninsured Americans: The most recent annual report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that almost 27.5 million Americans lacked health insurance for all of 2018.\n6: Here, we\u2019ll take a closer look at her first assertion that \"the 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.\"\n7: We found that the reality is more complicated than Omar portrayed it.\n8: A study says one thing, Omar said another Several days earlier, Omar shared a New York Times article about \"The Triumph of Injustice,\" a new book by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.\n9: The book by Saez and Zucman offered a similar statistic \u2014 one that received significant media attention .\n10: The book argues that in 2018, the richest 400 households in the United States paid a lower effective tax rate than households in any other income range.\n11: Effective tax rates refer to taxes paid as a percentage of income earned.\n12: Due to tax breaks and other factors, effective tax rates are usually lower than the statutory tax rates for a given income level.\n13: Some critics have questioned the Saez-Zucman methodology, saying it exaggerates the amount of taxes paid by lower-income Americans.\n14: That\u2019s because their analysis excluded refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, even though both are administered through the tax code.\n15: Failing to account for these tax refunds artificially shows higher tax payments for the lower-income households that take advantage of these credits, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center .\n16: That\u2019s important context, but there\u2019s something else to know for this fact-check: The statement Omar tweeted is not identical to the widely publicized finding of the Saez-Zucman book.\n17: First, their finding didn\u2019t address the top 1% of households \u2014 it addressed the top 400 households in the country.\n18: That\u2019s not a minor switch: The most recent IRS figures show that 1.4 million households belonged to the top 1%.\n19: That\u2019s a universe more than 3,500 times larger than the top 400 households.\n20: Second, Omar\u2019s tweet said the top 1% paid \"less in taxes\" than everyone else, which can be read to mean a dollar amount.\n21: However, the Saez-Zucman research addressed effective tax rates, which is the percentage of income paid in taxes, not the overall amount paid.\n22: How much does the 1% actually pay?\n23: By other measures, however, Omar has a stronger point that the richest 1% of Americans pay less in taxes than the rest of the country.\n24: Tax Policy Center estimates for 2019 show the top 1% paid 27% of all federal taxes, compared with 73% of taxes paid by the bottom 99%.\n25: Meanwhile, the total amount of tax dollars paid by the top 1% ($828 billion) was exceeded by the amount paid by the bottom 99% ($2.27 trillion).\n26: (Note: The center\u2019s baseline data account for all types of federal taxes, including individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, the estate tax, and excise taxes, but it excludes state and local taxes.)\n27: \"The congresswoman's statement was accurate \u2014\u2013 the richest 1% of Americans pay less in overall taxes than everyone else, no matter how you slice the data,\" said Jeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Omar.\n28: \"And while the federal tax system is more progressive, when you factor in state and local taxes , it paints a much more regressive picture of the taxes Americans pay.\"\n29: Still, it\u2019s not too surprising that a group 99 times as large would collectively pay more in taxes.\n30: Omar\u2019s decision to focus on this point obscures some key context: The 1% still pays a disproportionate share of the federal tax bill.\n31: How do we know this?\n32: This data shows that 1% of the U.S. tax-paying population earns 16.1% of the nation\u2019s pre-tax income.\n33: But it pays 27% of the tax burden.\n34: You can argue that the richest Americans should pay even more than 27% of the nation\u2019s taxes; either way, it\u2019s clear that the current tax system requires that a small but wealthy fraction of Americans shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden.",

        "passage": "0: An old video from a Republican political operative alleging that Cory Booker laundered money as mayor of Newark, N.J., has resurfaced on Twitter.\n1: The video, which was originally published on Facebook in September 2018, shows Roger Stone talking to the camera about Booker, a Democratic U.S. senator from New Jersey and a candidate for president.\n2: Stone is a veteran political consultant for Republicans and worked on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign in 2015.\n3: Stone was charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to Congress during former special prosecutor Rober Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n4: He is banned from social media pending a federal trial.\n5: \"As the mayor of Newark, Sen. Cory Booker took $600,000 from a city water authority and put it in his pocket.\n6: He told four different stories about it,\" Stone said in the video.\n7: \"If Cory were a white Republican, he\u2019d be in prison right now.\"\n8: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Facebook) A tweet from Red Nation Rising copied the video and its caption and published it Oct. 6.\n9: It\u2019s been retweeted more than 7,000 times, so we wanted to check it out.\n10: We reached out to Stone for the evidence he used to make his claim against Booker.\n11: We\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.\n12: An old water scandal The source of Stone\u2019s claim about Booker can be traced back to a corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp.\n13: But there is no evidence that Booker, who was Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, contributed to the bribery scheme.\n14: In 2014, a year after Booker left his post as mayor, a state controller report found \"an egregious and yet preventable abuse of public funds\" at the watershed.\n15: The city of Newark delegated water management to the agency through service contracts valued at roughly $10 million annually, but the report said the agency operated \"free from any meaningful oversight.\"\n16: The controller found that watershed Executive Director Linda Watkins-Brashear had authorized \"risky investment activity in an account that lost more than $500,000 in public funds.\"\n17: The agency dissolved in 2013 shortly after the controller first discovered the abuse of funds.\n18: Watkins-Brashear was later sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for handing out $1 million worth of contracts to her friends and ex-husband.\n19: At least eight other individuals connected to the scheme were also indicted \u2014\u00a0but not before the watershed\u2019s board of trustees sued Booker, Rep. Donald Payne Jr., D-N.J., and two dozen others for their alleged roles in the waste of taxpayer money.\n20: RELATED: Recent statements by and about Cory Booker The lawsuit claimed the actions of the defendants, including alleged misappropriation and waste of corporate assets, had led to the agency\u2019s dissolution.\n21: Booker\u2019s attorneys said at the time that the suit mischaracterized his role with the watershed.\n22: NJ.com reported that Booker served as an ex-officio chairman of the watershed\u2019s Board of Trustees (a position he held by virtue of being mayor), but he never attended a meeting.\n23: The lawsuit alleged that Booker\u2019s lack of oversight led to the agency\u2019s mismanagement.\n24: A federal judge disagreed and, in June 2016, Booker\u2019s name was dropped from the lawsuit.\n25: The judge ruled that Booker was immune from liability since his chairmanship was a function of his mayorship.\n26: \"Because there is no dispute that Booker was acting as a public employee in serving on the Board, and no argument that his actions (or inactions) as a member of the Board were other than discretionary and/or legislative in nature and required the exercise of his judgment, the Court finds that Booker is immune under N.J.S.A.\n27: \u00a7 59:3-2(a) and (b),\" Vincent Papala, a U.S. bankruptcy judge, wrote in the opinion .\n28: How Booker\u2019s old law firm is connected It appears that Stone took two stories about Booker\u2019s old law firm and used them to spin a conspiracy about his involvement in the water scandal.\n29: The first story was published by the New York Post in 2013.\n30: It reported that Booker\u2019s federal tax returns showed he collected $689,500 in payments from Trenk DiPasquale, the senator\u2019s former law firm, between 2007 and 2012 \u2014 while he was mayor of Newark.\n31: Booker had previously said he stopped working for the firm in 2006, soon after he became mayor.\n32: Booker\u2019s spokespeople told the New York Post at the time that the money wasn\u2019t a salary, but part of a \"separation agreement\" with the firm.\n33: The Daily Beast reported the agreement was paid out for work Booker did for the firm before he became mayor.\n34: From 2010 to 2012, Booker reported on his tax returns that he \"materially participate[d] in the operation of this business.\"\n35: A Booker spokesman told the New York Post it was an error made by a tax preparer.\n36: The second story, published by Politico in January 2017, reported that Elnardo Webster, one of Booker\u2019s longtime advisers, was the general counsel for the watershed while he worked at Trenk (and while Booker was mayor).\n37: However, neither he nor Booker have been charged with wrongdoing related to the bribery scandal.\n38: The Post reported that, as of 2013, Trenk had made $212,318 from the watershed.\n39: That\u2019s one-third of the $600,000 Stone alleged.\n40: According to a review of existing media reports and court records, there is no evidence of a money laundering scheme involving the two entities.\n41: Booker\u2019s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",

University of Minnesota professor of communications and expert on political advertising, said that because Facebook is a private unregulated platform, it can do what it wants.\n17: \"Because Facebook is its own playground, it gets to make its own rules,\" he said.\n18: Facebook has set rules about transparency to show who paid for ads .\n19: But it doesn\u2019t restrict political content.\n20: Federal rules for television There are rules, however, for television.\n21: Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 states: \"If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provision of this section.\"\n22: It also specifically says licensees can\u2019t censor \"material broadcast by any such candidate.\"\n23: Broadcasters are bound by that act and therefore can\u2019t reject a presidential candidate\u2019s ad, even if contains false information.\n24: (The candidates do have to abide by disclosure rules to make it clear who paid for the ad.)\n25: Every election season, some candidates argue that they have been unfairly attacked and that broadcasters should take down ads, wrote David Oxenford, a lawyer who has represented broadcasters for decades and is a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP.\n26: However, \"broadcasters can\u2019t censor a candidate ad, so they can\u2019t reject it (or remove it from the air) no matter what its content is,\" Oxenford wrote.\n27: There are caveats.The law does not apply to PACs or independent expenditure ads.\n28: And, importantly, the rules for political ads have been interpreted not to apply to cable networks such as CNN.\n29: The rules do apply to local cable operators.\n30: Cable networks somewhat subscribe to the idea in the act that they won\u2019t censor content, but they aren\u2019t bound by it, Terry said.\n31: CNN rejected an ad about Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor.\n32: The ad mentioned \"media lapdogs\" for the Democrats as it showed footage of CNN stars.\n33: The ad disparages CNN and \"makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets,\" a CNN spokesperson told PolitiFact.\n34: That ad was one of a handful of ads the Warren campaign cited as examples of political ads TV or radio rejected in recent years.\n35: Multiple stations and Facebook ultimately rejected a Trump ad about a migrant caravan in 2018 that critics said was racist.\n36: We sent Warren\u2019s examples to Terry, the University of Minnesota professor.\n37: He said that Warren\u2019s examples included issue ads, which aren\u2019t covered by the rule.\n38: \"It\u2019s only the campaign ads that are protected from the no-censorship provision,\" he said.\n39: The Warren campaign also cited an FCC website page that states broadcasters should \"act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading.\"\n40: However, it\u2019s the FCC law that bans censorship that truly carries weight.\n41: We also found that in May 2017, multiple networks refused to air a Trump ad about his first 100 days that had a \"fake news\" graphic superimposed over the photos of news anchors.\n42: It appeared networks rejected the ad by making a case that Trump didn\u2019t yet meet the legal qualifications of a candidate more than three years before the election.",

Kennedy said or wrote this statement,\" Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist with the library, wrote in an email.\n9: \"We do, however, have archival evidence that the article that featured the quotation was the subject of some concern in the administration, based on a National Security Council meeting about Vietnam that took place the same day the article was published.\"\n10: Chandler pointed us to an Oct. 2, 1963, article by Scripps-Howard staff writer Richard Starnes, who was reporting from Saigon, Vietnam, at the time.\n11: The article, \"\u2018Arrogant\u2019 CIA Disobeys Orders in Viet Nam,\" was published in the Washington Daily News.\n12: The following passage appears about halfway through the article: \"Other American agencies here are incredibly bitter about the CIA.\n13: 'If the United States ever experiences a 'Seven Days in May' it will come from the CIA, and not the Pentagon,' one U.S. official commented caustically.\"\n14: \"Seven Days in May\" is a fictional book, published in 1962, of a military attempt to overthrow the U.S. government.\n15: Starnes adds later in the article that a \"very high American official here, a man who has spent much of his life in the service of democracy, likened the CIA's growth to a malignancy, and added he was not sure even the White House could control it any longer.\"\n16: But he doesn\u2019t name that official and indicates that several anonymous sources provided quotes like that of the \"U.S. official\" to whom the coup comment is attributed.\n17: A New York Times article about Starnes\u2019 report was published the following day.\n18: In it, reporter Arthur Krock wrote about Starnes\u2019 article and combines some of the quotes into one paragraph: \"Among the views attributed to United States officials on the scene, including one described as a 'very high American official...who has spent much of his life in service of democracy...are the following: The CIA's growth was 'likened to a malignancy; which the 'very high official was not sure even the White House could control...any longer.'\n19: 'If the United States ever experiences [an attempt at a coup to overthrow the Government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.'\n20: The agency 'represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.'\"\n21: This passage puts the \"very high American official\" in close proximity to the quotation in question, and may be the reason people started to attach the words to Kennedy.\n22: \"In the archives here, we do have evidence that John F. Kennedy was aware of the Starnes piece,\" Chandler said.\n23: She said Kennedy mentioned it in the Oct. 2, 1963, National Security Council meeting , according to the meeting summary (located on page 27 of the scanned document here ): \"The President then asked what we should say about the news story attacking CIA which appeared in today's Washington Daily News.\n24: He read a draft paragraph for inclusion in the public statement but rejected it as being too fluffy.\n25: He felt no one would believe a statement saying that there were no differences of view among the various US agencies represented in Saigon.\n26: He thought that we should say now we had a positive policy endorsed by the National Security Council and that such policy would be carried out by all concerned.\"",

Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\n15: But it wasn\u2019t the same thing.\n16: Also, Paine\u2019s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association.\n17: Paine also never used the term \"citizen's dividend\" in relation to his proposal (he called it \"the plan\"), Berton said.\n18: \"Martin Luther King, champion in the \u201860s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968.\"\n19: It is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\"\n20: But he wasn\u2019t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.\n21: King wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty.\n22: \"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective \u2014 the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote.\n23: Yang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B.\n24: King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.\n25: King was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.\n26: He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay.\n27: King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People\u2019s Campaign , Thompson said.\n28: \"Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,\" Thompson said.\n29: \"It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus.\"\n30: \"It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\n31: The House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that \"were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,\" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n32: The New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon\u2019s revision of the welfare system, establishing \"for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working.\"\n33: The proposal included a work requirement.\n34: In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income.\n35: While there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a \"guaranteed annual income,\" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time.\n36: \"Nixon\u2019s plan was more \u2018conservative\u2019 than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,\" Steensland said.\n37: \"His rhetoric was very work-oriented.\n38: Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the \u2018welfare rolls\u2019 to the \u2018payrolls,\u2019 though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources.\"\n39: Another key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients\u2019 income level.\n40: Universal basic income proposals, like Yang\u2019s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: In Facebook ads that launched in August featuring Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, and conservative radio talk show host Dennis Prager, older Americans are urged to forgo their AARP memberships for another organization: the Association of Mature American Citizens, otherwise known as AMAC.\n1: The ads say they were sponsored and paid for by AMAC, and they challenge the idea that AARP is a \"nonpartisan organization.\"\n2: \"But you need to understand WHAT you are supporting if you are an AARP member,\" they continue.\n3: \"AARP backed Obamacare, strict gun control, and federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n4: AMAC fought AGAINST all of these things.\"\n5: We found a number of other posts on Facebook in which users claimed AARP \"supports abortion,\" a service many Planned Parenthood clinics provide.\n6: We wondered if the AMAC ads were correct to say that AARP backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n7: In an email, AMAC political liaison Ellen Cora told us that as an American over the age of 65 \u2014 and an AARP member herself \u2014 she recalls AARP bulletins that spoke \"positively about Planned Parenthood,\" adding \"we often refer to \u2018AARP Beyond the Veil\u2019 for more information about AARP.\"\n8: \"Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn\u2019t Know,\" was a 2011 report prepared by U.S. Reps. Wally Herger, R.-Calif, and Dave Reichert, R.-Wash.\n9: It was released as a House subcommittee opened a hearing examining AARP\u2019s tax-exempt status.\n10: CNN then reported that Republicans were targeting the group in the wake of the report that claimed to expose \"the conflict between AARP\u2019s drive for profits, the best interests of its members and the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status.\"\n11: Democrats argued the attacks stemmed from AARP\u2019s support of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill, according to CNN.\n12: But the report makes no mention of Planned Parenthood.\n13: When we followed up, Jeff Szymanski, another AMAC political liaison, said he recalled \"it was a radio personality that made the claim you cite, not AMAC.\"\n14: The language in the ad featuring radio personality Dennis Prager is virtually identical to the ad featuring Sebastian Gorka.\n15: They both link to AMAC\u2019s website and say they are sponsored and paid for by AMAC.\n16: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We asked Szymanski if AMAC didn\u2019t write the ads but he didn\u2019t reply.\n17: Instead, he directed PolitiFact to a page about AARP on the website 2ndVote.com , which calls itself the \"conservative watchdog for corporate activism.\"\n18: Under a section labeled \"life,\" the page says: \"AARP is a corporate supporter of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which is a pro-abortion organization.\"\n19: It links to the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s 2013-14 report , which lists AARP among the organizations that contributed $25,000-$49,999 to the center in the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2014.\n20: 2ndVote.com also links to a fact sheet the center produced about marriage equality.\n21: It doesn\u2019t mention abortion, though.\n22: The National Women\u2019s Law Center advocates for gender justice, according to its website , \"working across the issues that are central to the lives of women and girls.\"\n23: Its issues include child care, racial justice, and health care and reproductive rights.\n24: Abortion, according to the center , \"is a key part of women\u2019s liberty, equality, and economic security.\"\n25: In 2013, the center produced a fact-sheet called \"The Hyde Amendment Hurts Women.\"\n26: The amendment says the federal government can\u2019t pay for abortions except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger or if she became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, and the center calls it a \"hurtful ban\" that harms low-income women.\n27: We emailed AARP to ask about AMAC\u2019s claim and supporting evidence.\n28: Spokesman Jason Young confirmed that AARP made a donation to the center and pointed us to an IRS filing that says AARP donated $25,000 that year \"to support the protect and improve Social Security for women project.\"\n29: Social Security is another of the law center\u2019s issues .\n30: On its website, it says it works with lawmakers to develop proposals to strengthen Social Security and increase benefits to improve women\u2019s retirement security.\n31: In 2013, Young said, AARP, the law center and and other groups opposed \"chained CPI,\" which the Washington Post describes in this explainer as \"a way to index spending and taxes \u2014 including Social Security benefits \u2014 to the rate of inflation, or the rise in prices over time.\"\n32: Social Security benefits would have increased at a slower rate using this index and AARP, among others, considered it an unjustifiable cut to Social Security benefits.\n33: AARP \"does not have a position on abortion,\" Young said.\n34: \"AARP does not fund and has not funded Planned Parenthood.\n35: AARP has not supported or lobbied for federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\"\n36: He also noted that JPMorgan Chase, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citi among others contributed to the National Women\u2019s Law Center the same year AARP did.\n37: Planned Parenthood Federation of America was another of the center\u2019s supporters that year, kicking in $5,000-$9,999.\n38: The organization historically received federal funding through Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care and Title X , a Health and Human Services grant program that funds comprehensive family planning services.\n39: However, Planned Parenthood and others are banned from using federal funds for abortion services except in instances of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is in danger.\n40: And, recently, because of a Trump administration rule that would deny Title X funds to any health clinics that refer women for abortions, Planned Parenthood has opted \u2014 for now \u2014 not to participate in the program.\n41: The Affordable Care Act, the comprehensive health care law known as Obamacare, did not designate any funds to Planned Parenthood in particular, said Benjamin Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at the Harvard T.H.\n42: Chan School of Public Health.\n43: Rather, he told us, it expanded health insurance to 20 million people, and some of those people may have gotten care at Planned Parenthood.\n44: \"But it seems a stretch to argue that AARP support for the ACA was directly advocating funds to Planned Parenthood any more than it was advocating sending funds to any qualifying health care provider nationally \u2014\u00a0of which there are thousands,\" he said.\n45: \"I think the more reasonable interpretation is that AARP was supporting expanded health insurance, not advocating for any particular health care provider.\"\n46: Gretchen Ely, a professor at the University of Buffalo\u2019s School of Social Work, echoed that sentiment.\n47: \"It seems especially far-fetched in this particular example, given AARP\u2019s focus on folks who are aging into retirement,\" she said.\n48: In November 2009, when AARP endorsed the Affordable Health Care for America Act \u2014 the House\u2019s version of the health care reform legislation \u2014 Barry Rand, then AARP\u2019s CEO, said in a statement , that the bill contained \"critical components AARP has been fighting for on behalf of its members and all older Americans to improve health care for them and their families.\"\n49: He cited examples, including \"protecting and strengthening Medicare for today\u2019s seniors and future generations of retirees\" and \"lowering drug costs for seniors.\"\n50: He doesn\u2019t mention Planned Parenthood, family planning or abortion.\n51: More recently, in 2017, AARP opposed the American Health Care Act, the GOP health care bill that would have repealed a large swath of Obamacare.\n52: Among its provisions, the measure also effectively blocked Planned Parenthood from securing reimbursements from Medicaid for a year.\n53: Sens.\n54: Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska., and Susan Collins, R-Maine \u2014 who alongside Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joined Democrats to kill the bill in the Senate \u2014\u00a0had cited Planned Parenthood funding as one of the conditions of their support for the bill.\n55: AARP published a post on its website in June 2017 titled, \"5 ways the Senate health care bill would hurt you.\"\n56: But it focused on \"skyrocketing insurance premiums,\" coverage and Medicare services, not Planned Parenthood funding.\n57: To claim they opposed the bill because of Planned Parenthood is a \"fully misleading assertion,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor at George Washington University.\n58: What\u2019s more, Rosenbaum told us, while AARP has advocated for health benefits and women\u2019s preventive health services, she\u2019s unaware of any specific lobbying or advocacy AARP has done for Planned Parenthood.\n59: \"It would be so totally unlike them to advocate for another organization,\" she said, \"it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\"",

Nelson, a mechanical engineer at SUNY New Paltz, told us he thinks the reported number of uses does not specifically refer to hemp, but instead refers to cellulose.\n32: Dynamite and cellophane are derived from cellulose.\n33: While hemp could provide sugars through the enzymatic breakdown of cellulose, it\u2019s a lot easier and cheaper to get those sugars from corn starch or sugar cane, said Cornell professor Lawrence B.\n34: Smart.\n35: \"The 25,000 products is a great number, but please put it in context,\" Smart said.\n36: \"Since we get most of our paper products from eucalyptus and lumber products from pine, how many products can you make from eucalyptus and pine?\"\n37: Hemp\u2019s on the rise, but future hard to predict What matters most, said Gilbert Jenkins, is \"for the first time in a generation we are able to innovate around this versatile crop.\"\n38: The 2018 farm bill legalized industrial use of hemp and removed it from the federal list of controlled substances, opening up the market to new products.\n39: According to Vote Hemp,\u00a0 the number of acres of grown hemp tripled between 2017 and 2018, and hemp-based product sales have also climbed .\n40: Fried\u2019s spokesman Franco Ripple pointed to examples of hemp being used in hempcrete to build homes , composites to build products like cars , and hemp-based packaging and plastic alternatives .\n41: Hemp-based products should increasingly replace specific uses of Styrofoam, plastic, and concrete, he added.\n42: \"Her forward-looking statements on the future of hemp and potential uses are intended to inspire the industry\u2019s development,\" he said, citing predictions about the future growth of hemp.\n43: But there are challenges to using hemp in the United States.\n44: For example, Gilbert Jenkins is partnering with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to make hemp jeans.\n45: \"We are in the process of sending a bale of hemp fiber to Poland to be processed into yarn because that capability does not exist in the United States currently,\" she said.\n46: \"Our textile industry is set up to work with cotton short fibers, not long hemp fibers.\"\n47: As for Ripple\u2019s examples, they don\u2019t represent the majority of current hemp use.\n48: About 80 percent of hemp grown in the United States is for hemp extracts including cannabidiol, or CBD, said Eric Steenstra, Vote Hemp\u2019s president.\n49: Experts also told us that hempcrete is intended to replace other components within a wall, such as sheetrock, and not the concrete itself.\n50: Also, hemp won\u2019t replace plastics.\n51: Hemp fibers can be used to strengthen plastics and other composite materials.\n52: Hemp oil can replace the petroleum oil raw material for the plastic, which \"is still plastic with all of its downsides,\" said Gilbert Jenkins.\n53: Hemp has scarcely penetrated the building and plastic replacement markets, Small said.\n54: \"The future seems limited, albeit not impossible.\"",

used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47 -style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds.\n11: The Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.\n12: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous rhetoric At least two times previously, O\u2019Rourke was asked whether he would support confiscation of guns he calls weapons of war.\n13: He said yes.\n14: Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate Co-host David Muir: \"Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country.\n15: You've gone further.\n16: You've said, quote, \u2018Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.\u2019 You know that critics call this confiscation.\n17: Are you proposing taking away their guns?\n18: And how would this work?\"\n19: O\u2019Rourke: \"I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield.\n20: ...When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"\n21: Sept. 18\u00a0CNN\u2019s \"Cuomo Prime Time Host Chris Cuomo : \"All right, so let's state the proposition.\n22: Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation?\n23: O'Rourke: \"Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield.\n24: ...So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes.\n25: But when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no.\"\n26: How else O\u2019Rourke has described his proposal On the same day as the \"Morning Joe\" interview, CNN \"New Day\" host Alysin Camerota asked O\u2019Rourke: \"How do you plan to get assault weapons away from people who don\u2019t want to give them up?\"\n27: O\u2019Rourke replied: \"It\u2019s pretty simple.\n28: As with any law in this country, we would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law.\"\n29: Later, Camerota pushed back by saying mass shooters would not follow such a law.\n30: Then she said of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal: \"It sounds like confiscation.\"\n31: O\u2019Rourke replied: \"No, I\u2019m not suggesting that.\n32: And I think that\u2019s why people use the word confiscation, because it scares people.\n33: What I\u2019m talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own an AR-15 or an AK-47 will sell that weapon back to the government.\n34: O\u2019Rourke made similar comments on \"Morning Joe.\"\n35: Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell.\n36: O\u2019Rourke said: \"Just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have\u00a0to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law.\n37: So, i n that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.\"\n38: (Update: We\u2019ve added some additional context from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement after initially publishing this fact-check.)\n39: Asked later in the interview about going door to door to take conventional handguns, O\u2019Rourke said they aren\u2019t as lethal as assault-style weapons and there is a legitimate use of handguns for protection in a home.\n40: To confiscate or not ... O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign website says he is calling for \"a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns,\" and that \"individuals who fail to participate in the mandatory buyback of assault weapons will be fined.\"\n41: \"Beto has been clear that he is talking about a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, which is not confiscation,\" his campaign told us.\n42: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s argument that his plan isn\u2019t confiscation ultimately rests on the fact that the government would buy the guns away from its owner.\n43: But that\u2019s misleading.\n44: Gun owners wouldn\u2019t have a say in the matter, and just because they\u2019d be compensated, some likely wouldn\u2019t see the trade in terms of equal value.\n45: Owners would be required to sell, and if they didn\u2019t, what happens next is murky.\n46: O\u2019Rourke says people might be fined, and that they might be somehow compelled to turn their weapons in through the buy-back program.\n47: As you game out scenarios how this might play out, they all lead to something that most people would consider confiscation.\n48: Clearly, many gun owners who legally purchased and own weapons that the government would take would view that as confiscation, even if they were paid for the guns.\n49: \"It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O\u2019Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,\" gun law expert George Mocsary , a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact.\n50: \"Imagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell.\n51: He or she is issued a fine.\n52: The owner still has the weapon, however.\n53: Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal?\n54: Certainly not,\" Mocsary said.\n55: \"There is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it.\n56: That is confiscation.\"",

        "passage": "0: A Facebook post that\u2019s been shared over 55,000 times claims that a little trick before bed each night may cure your restless legs syndrome.\n1: The post reads: \"Restless Legs Syndrome: Drink a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed until symptoms go away.\n2: Tonic water contains quinine, which stops repeated muscle contractions -Paul Lyons, MD.\"\n3: It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n4: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n5: While medical experts say it\u2019s probably not harmful to consume a small cup of tonic water each night, it\u2019s not scientifically proven to help cure or alleviate restless legs syndrome , a condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, usually at night or while lying down.\n6: Prevention Magazine, a healthy lifestyle magazine published by the Hearst Corporation, is listed as the source of the post.\n7: We found a 2016 article from the magazine titled \"14 Natural Ways To Deal With Restless Legs Syndrome.\"\n8: (We also came across a 2008 story by ABC News that mirrors the post\u2019s wording.)\n9: About halfway through the Prevention Magazine article, the tonic water method is mentioned: \"...\n10: The FDA has banned the sale of quinine because it reportedly caused some serious side effects (though rare), but it's still available in one form, Qualaquin, for the treatment of malaria, and it's still available in very small amounts in tonic water.\n11: So even though studies show it doesn't work, and even though tonic water contains only a token amount of quinine\u2014an 8-ounce glass of tonic water has about 20 mg, compared with the 200 to 300 mg dose you'd need to quiet leg cramps\u2014some patients swear by it.\"\n12: It continues to cite a medical consultant from the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation who said that although it may not be supported by science, a home remedy that couldn\u2019t hurt and could help is worth a try.\n13: But while the low amount of quinine found in tonic water is not considered harmful, the Food and Drug Administration has warned that the research for the use of quinine products for leg cramps or similar conditions is out-of-date, and that \"there has been significant concern regarding its unfavorable risk/benefit ratio.\"\n14: Most medical professionals also say people shouldn\u2019t rely on the tonic water tactic.\n15: Dr. Mark Buchfuhrer, a restless legs syndrome expert and member of the RLS Foundation's scientific and medical advisory board, told PolitiFact that quinine has no benefit for treating the disorder.\n16: \"The typical dose of Quinine for leg cramps is more than 200-300 mg. A 6 ounce glass of tonic water contains less than 15 mg of quinine.\n17: One would have to drink close to a gallon of tonic water to get the therapeutic effect for leg cramps,\" Buchfuhrer wrote in an email.\n18: \"It is one of these \u2018Urban Legends\u2019 that may possibly be true for one leg condition then gets spread to other conditions that may affect the legs ...There are likely many patients who believe that both treatments are effective for RLS but they likely work through the strong placebo effect.\"\n19: While clinical evidence shows that quinine helps leg cramps, Buchfuhrer said, few decent medical studies back that up.\n20: He recommended other treatments such as regular exercise, avoiding exacerbating drugs like antihistamines, antidepressants; increasing iron levels if they are low, and avoiding alcohol.\n21: Doctors Hope Ricciotti and Hye-Chun Hur also wrote for Harvard Medical School about the lack of science behind the tonic water method and list other ways people can alleviate RLS symptoms: \"Drinking a few ounces of tonic water shouldn't be harmful, but it isn't likely to prevent your leg cramps.\"\n22: They instead recommend \"making sure to get enough fluids, avoiding caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, stretching during the day or before bed, and, when a cramp starts, standing on the affected leg, applying ice or heat and gently massaging the affected muscle.\"",

        "claim": "The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level.",
        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: Are the vast majority\u00a0of Wisconsin students failing to achieve at grade level?\n1: That was the claim made in a recent radio address by state Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt .\n2: The Fond du Lac Republican \u2014 a former teacher and principal \u2014 chairs the state Assembly Committee on Education .\n3: That makes him a key player in any school-related changes the Republican-controlled Legislature brings before Democratic Gov.\n4: Tony Evers.\n5: In the Republicans\u2019 statewide weekly radio address on Sept. 19, 2019, Thiesfeldt said Wisconsin has to \"do better\" on education, especially given the amount of money the state spent there in the eight years of Republican control under former Gov.\n6: Scott Walker.\n7: Then he said this: \"The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level.\"\n8: That\u2019s an alarming stat if true.\n9: Assessing his claim takes us deep into state and national testing thresholds and some shifting definitions.\n10: Let\u2019s get started.\n11: Claim built on latest test scores As proof, Thiesfeldt\u2019s staff pointed to the most recent Wisconsin Student Assessment System results.\n12: The annual tests include the Forward Exam for grades three to eight and ACT-related tests for grades nine to 11.\n13: In the 2018-19 tests, 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, and 40.1% reached those levels for math, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction .\n14: For starters, calling 60% the \"vast majority\" is overstating things quite a bit.\n15: But let\u2019s focus on the \"grade level\" part of Thiesfeldt\u2019s claim.\n16: Is it reasonable to say anyone below proficient is also below grade level?\n17: That\u2019s a very complicated question.\n18: DPI breaks the assessment scores into four categories of student achievement : advanced, proficient, basic and below basic.\n19: We\u2019ll focus on the middle two since that\u2019s where this claim is centered.\n20: Proficient \u2013 Student demonstrates adequate understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.\n21: Basic \u2013 Student demonstrates partial understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness.\n22: Katie Scott, a policy adviser in Thiesfeldt\u2019s office, highlighted the \"adequate understanding\" element of the proficient definition.\n23: \"For an exam taken in the final months of the school year, we are confident that parents, teachers, etc.\n24: would not prefer the achievement of students at grade level to be described as a \u2018partial understanding,\u2019\" she said in an email.\n25: Scott also asserted that proficient \"has always meant at or above grade level.\"\n26: Definitions a moving target So Thiesfeldt\u2019s argument is that proficiency = grade level.\n27: But both sides of that equation are moving targets.\n28: The term grade level is used at times to refer to how students perform relative to a standard set by officials, which is how Thiesfeldt uses it.\n29: But it can also refer to what students typically learn in a grade, in other words the median test score for that age level across the state.\n30: We\u2019ll stick to the idea that grade level is some kind of threshold.\n31: But it\u2019s tricky equating it to proficiency since the definition of proficient has changed over time in Wisconsin.\n32: In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk , a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n33: But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold.\n34: The state was aligning its standards to match the National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 also called the Nation\u2019s Report Card .\n35: In other words, proficient no longer means what it once did in Wisconsin.\n36: Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does?\n37: \"The answer is quite emphatically no,\" Borsuk said.\n38: He elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column .\n39: \"I\u2019m increasingly willing to lump \u2018basic\u2019 with \u2018proficient\u2019 and \u2018advanced\u2019 to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,\" Borsuk wrote.\n40: \"And if you do that, you come up with \u2014 to give one example \u2014 about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient.\"\n41: Tom Loveless , a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group\u2019s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state\u2019s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago.\n42: But there\u2019s still more evidence to consider.\n43: National test warns against equating proficient with \"grade level\" A Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spokesman didn\u2019t take a position on proficient vs. grade level beyond the definitions cited above.\n44: But the go-to source for national testing sheds some light on the matter.\n45: The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a congressionally authorized project of the U.S. Department of Education that measures student achievement in select subjects across the nation.\n46: Remember, Wisconsin made changes to its scale get in sync with NAEP.\n47: An August 2019 study by the NAEP found the state was quite successful in doing so.\n48: The analysis scored each state from 0 to 500 in two subjects at two grade levels to show how high the bar was to achieve proficiency.\n49: That could then be compared to other states and the national scale used by NAEP.\n50: For grade four math, the state and national standards were exactly the same at 249.\n51: For grade four reading, the score for NAEP proficiency was 238, while Wisconsin\u2019s was 229.\n52: The eighth-grade scores were also very close, with the state and national threshold separated by two points for reading and four points for math.\n53: And here\u2019s what the NAEP has to say about conflating proficiency with grade level : Myth : The NAEP Proficient level is like being on grade level.\n54: Fact : NAEP Proficient means competency over challenging subject matter.\n55: This is not the same as being \"on grade level,\" which refers to performance on local curriculum and standards.\n56: NAEP is a general assessment of knowledge and skills in a particular subject.\n57: \"NAEP proficient means mastery over challenging subject matter,\" said NAEP spokesman Grady Wilburn.\n58: \"We don\u2019t use any terms in NAEP to equate achievement level to what may be grade level in a state.\n59: \u2026 The achievement level proficient, for example, is aspirational.\n60: We don\u2019t define that as something necessary to proceed from one grade to the next.\"\n61: So the Wisconsin proficiency standard is largely in line with the national standard, and the people behind the national standard warn it should not be conflated with \"grade level.\"\n62: Therefore, Wisconsin should be similarly careful, Loveless said.\n63: \"Wisconsin set its cut point at the NAEP proficiency level on purpose,\" he said.\n64: \"So it should carry with it all the warnings that go with the NAEP proficient cut point.\"\n65: For the record, Wisconsin students ranked about average in the latest NAEP data.\n66: In 2017, 40% of students nationwide tested at or above the proficient level using the NAEP standard.\n67: Wisconsin came in at 42% .\n68: The NAEP study also showed Wisconsin has one of the highest bars for proficiency in the nation.\n69: The grade eight ratings were third- and fourth-highest among the states in the study, and grade four ratings came in 10th and 18th.",

Bush and Barack Obama, was right that Trump has shipped 14,000 troops to the Middle East since May.\n7: Spoiler: McGurk\u2019s claim is spot-on.\n8: The latest on Syria, American troops McGurk said he got his numbers from the Pentagon, which touted its troop commitments in an Oct. 11 press release announcing the deployment of about 3,000 U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia.\n9: The press release said the Pentagon had \"increased the number of forces by approximately 14,000 to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility\" since May.\n10: Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeated the same figures while briefing reporters that same day.\n11: The Pentagon told us the term \"area of responsibility\" refers to \"the entire Middle East,\" while Will Todman, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it also includes Afghanistan and other parts of central Asia.\n12: (Definitions of the Middle East vary.)\n13: But Todman said the recent reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan likely means more have been deployed to the Middle East anyway.\n14: So yes, Trump has sent 14 times as many soldiers to the Middle East as the approximately 1,000 troops that he pledged to remove when he announced his decision to pull out of Syria.\n15: \"Trump is using the rhetoric of ending endless war, but in reality he is waging more war,\" said Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank.\n16: \"In the Middle East, he is simply moving troops from one region to another.\n17: But relocation is not departure.\"\n18: On Oct. 19 , Esper said the soldiers in northeast Syria would be relocated to western Iraq where they would \"help defend Iraq\" and fight against ISIS.\n19: More recently, Esper said the United States was considering leaving some troops behind to secure the region\u2019s oil fields, according to the Associated Press .\n20: Troops began withdrawing to Iraq on Oct. 21, per the Wall Street Journal .\n21: Experts told us it\u2019s difficult to determine how U.S. forces are distributed in the Middle East, in part because of changes former Defense Secretary James Mattis made to reduce transparency.\n22: According to June data from the Pentagon \u2014 which omits numbers for countries with ongoing operations such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 there were at that time 283 total U.S. forces in Egypt, 76 in Israel, 20 in Lebanon, 1,750 in Turkey, 84 in Jordan, 2,077 in Kuwait, 535 in Saudi Arabia, 19 in Yemen, 17 in Oman, 374 in the United Arab Emirates, 636 in Qatar, and 4,865 in Bahrain.\n23: Those numbers include active duty personnel, national guard and reserve personnel and civilian personnel.\n24: According to the Royal Institute of International Affairs , a London think tank, they do not include temporary forces or classified special forces operating in secret.\n25: The June numbers are also outdated.\n26: The Pentagon told us it would not identify the recently deployed personnel by country, but it said more than 6,500 of the 14,000 soldiers sent out since May are at sea as part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group.\n27: Still, experts told us the largest numbers of U.S. forces currently stationed in or near the Middle East are likely in Bahrain, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar\u00a0and Afghanistan.",

Donovan began enforcing a new public records rule this month that sparked criticism from transparency advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n1: The rule prevents members of the public from photographing records they are examining unless they pay a fee to reimburse staff for the cost of preparing the documents.\n2: Gov.\n3: Phil Scott and Secretary of State Jim Condos have said that there is no legal basis for the government to charge members of the public to take photos of records.\n4: The attorney general says he interprets the law differently.\n5: Defending his new policy, Donovan has argued that taxpayers should be reimbursed for the time it takes his staff to locate, scrutinize and redact records before inspection\u2014particularly when the majority of requests don't come from members of the public, or the press, but private entities.\n6: \"Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General\u2019s Office are from private law firms and companies,\" Donovan wrote in an op-ed published by VTDigger last week.\n7: \"There is a cost to Vermonters associated with diverting attorney time and resources from my office\u2019s mission,\" he added.\n8: \"More to the point, should we provide free legal work to law firms and companies that may take an adverse position to the policies of our state?\"\n9: VTDigger has already asked Donovan\u2019s office to reverse its policy on photographing records.\n10: But his justification for it raised even more questions.\n11: Do \"most\" requests to his office really come from companies and law firms?\n12: On Thursday, a day before Donovan's op-ed was published, his office reported that 49% of the public records requests the attorney general's office received this year have come from companies.\n13: As of Monday, the office said that number had dropped slightly, to about 45%.\n14: Out of the 126 requests submitted to the attorney general this year, 32 came from members of the press, and 37 came from citizens acting independently, according to a review of the requests submitted to the office which are publicly available online .\n15: The remaining 57 requests\u201445.2%\u2014 came from companies, law firms and non-profits, which the attorney general's office lumps into one category, \"firms,\" when it tracks incoming records requests, according to Charity Clark, Donovan's chief of staff.\n16: Within this category, it\u2019s true that law offices and private companies filed most of the requests.\n17: But nine of the requests in this category came from non-profits, interest groups and, in one case, a law school.\n18: Four of the requests came from Energy Policy Advocates, a conservative-leaning non-profit dedicated to bringing \"transparency to the realm of energy and environmental policy.\"\n19: Also among the requesters categorized as \"firms\" were the National Consumer Law Center, a non-profit that focuses on legal and policy work for low income citizens; the Public Rights Project, an organization that advances civil rights and economic justice policies; and Judicial Watch, another right-leaning non-profit focused on government transparency.\n20: A request from Vermont Legal Aid and another from a student at the University of Chicago School of Law were also included in the \"firms\" category.\n21: Clark said that the attorney general's office has been tracking public records requests like this for years, starting before Donovan took office.\n22: \"Something that's not a citizen and not a member of the press is going to be in this other group,\" she said.\n23: However, Donovan referred to this entire class of requesters as \"private law firms and companies,\" a description that should not encompass universities, non-profit public interest groups and legal support clinics.\n24: If the \"firms\" category excluded non-profits, there would be nine fewer requests: meaning the total number of from private law firms and companies would only be to 38% of all requests.",

        "passage": "0: A Facebook post portrays Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard as a supporter of the anti-fascist movement, claiming that a photo shows her posing with someone who leads the movement.\n1: \"Antifa Fascist Fangirl Tulsi Gabbard posing with Evan Duke, leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE,\" said an Oct. 22 Facebook post that\u2019s been shared more than 100 times.\n2: (The post says \"antifa fascist\" \u2014 yet antifa is short for anti-fascist.)\n3: The picture used in the post does include a man named Evan Duke who appears to support the antifa movement.\n4: But Duke and an antifa group in Portland, Ore., told PolitiFact that Duke does not lead antifa nor Occupy ICE.\n5: The photo circulating on Facebook was taken in North Dakota when Gabbard went there to support veterans and others protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and its potential impact on water safety and tribal lands.\n6: The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n7: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n8: PolitiFact requested comment from Gabbard\u2019s congressional office and presidential campaign.\n9: Her congressional office referred us to her campaign, which did not respond to our queries.\n10: What is antifa and Occupy ICE?\n11: Antifa is a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups across the country that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence.\n12: The antifa movement goes back decades , but regained attention after antifa groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\n13: Conservative group Turning Point USA in August 2019 asked Gabbard if she would be willing to denounce antifa.\n14: \"I have denounced antifa,\" Gabbard said .\n15: Occupy ICE is a movement that protests and wants the abolishment of the federal immigration agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n16: The movement gained traction in June 2018 with protests of the Trump administration\u2019s \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy.\n17: Origin of the picture in the Facebook post The Facebook photo features Gabbard and seven other people.\n18: Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, posted a similar picture of the group on her Facebook page on Dec. 10, 2016.\n19: She described the people in the image as a group of veterans helping with safety and security operations at a camp protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline .\n20: \"I'm honored to have met these incredible veterans, who inspire as they continue their mission of service,\" Gabbard\u2019s post said.\n21: \"They are in this for the long haul, planning to stay until the drilling pad and construction equipment are removed.\n22: #nodapl #mniwiconi #waterislife #veterans.\"\n23: The photo in the Oct. 22 Facebook post also appears on a website called Hallwalls, on a page that promoted a January 2017 event by a group called VeteransRespond.\n24: The group planned to present a \"storytelling event featuring United States military veterans who stood at Standing Rock.\"\n25: The page describes VeteransRespond as a national service organization formed by veterans who went to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.\n26: The Hallwalls caption for the photo identified one of the men as \"Evan Duke (Occupy Wall St.)\" Who is Evan Duke?\n27: Snopes.com found a Facebook account for someone named Evan K Duke III, who on Dec. 9, 2016, posted a picture similar to the one posted by Gabbard and to the one now circulating on Facebook.\n28: Duke\u2019s post said: \" #NoDAPL #StrengthAndHonor Occupy/Veterans camp built an HQ and barracks for incoming vets at Standing Rock with donations from people across the United States.\n29: We processed and housed as many people as we could on the ground during the blizzards.\n30: We were invited to be Tulsi Gabbard's security detail during her stay at camp.\n31: Before she left she came to our little plywood and 2x4 HQ to tell us how proud of us she was.\n32: With tears in her eyes she told us we were on the right path to creating the change this nation needs.\n33: We shed tears with her and said our Alohas.\n34: We taught her the Lakota word Doksha (until we see you again).\n35: Farewell relative.\n36: You are one of us!\"\n37: PolitiFact reached out to that account, and the user confirmed he was in the picture being shared on Facebook.\n38: Duke\u2019s account includes antifa-related posts, but he said he was not the leader of antifa nor of Occupy ICE.\n39: \"Whoever made such claims clearly has no understanding of how de-centralized movements work,\" Duke said.\n40: \"There are no leaders, there is no formal organization, their (sic) are no meetings, plans, rosters.\n41: Within those movements there are simply autonomous activists organizing as they see fit.\"\n42: Duke\u2019s Facebook account also posted a detailed message on Aug. 26, 2016, to actress Shailene Woodley\u2019s Facebook page.\n43: Duke wrote that he was with \"Occupy Inauguration Planning Committee,\" a mass rally scheduled for Inauguration Day in January 2017 in D.C.\n44: He asked Woodley for her endorsement and participation.\n45: (Woodley had supported protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.)\n46: PolitiFact reached out to a group called Rose City Antifa (whose website said it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore.) asking if Duke was the \"leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE,\" as the Facebook post claimed.\n47: \"Evan Duke is not the leader of Portland Antifa, he is not a member of our organization, and he is not the leader of Occupy ICE,\" the group responded in an email.\n48: They said he had never been the leader of the groups, either.",

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., about the dossier, Fusion GPS (the opposition research firm that created it) and how the Clinton campaign was involved.\n15: We found that Fusion GPS was hired to work on behalf of the Clinton campaign, but the firm was already investigating Trump at the time.\n16: Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media website.\n17: The Democratic National Committee, through its law firm Perkins Coie and for the benefit of the Clinton campaign, hired the opposition research firm to collect information after Trump won the Republican nomination.\n18: Then, Fusion GPS hired Steele to produce memos on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n19: Bill Clinton \"made $500k for a Russian speech\" This is accurate.\n20: The source of the claim is the 2015 book \"Clinton Cash\" by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer.\n21: During an April 2015 interview about the book on Fox News Sunday, he said something that caught our eye: \"Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state.\"\n22: We rated that claim True .\n23: And in the course of our investigation of Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms , we found that former President Clinton gave a talk in 2010 to a Russian finance corporation.\n24: He was compensated $500,000.\n25: Hillary Clinton \"sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia\" This is misleading.\n26: We rated a similar claim Mostly False.\n27: The claim also stems from Schweizer\u2019s \"Clinton Cash.\"\n28: A chapter of the book suggests a pay-for-play scheme between the Clintons and Russia, accusing them of transferring uranium in exchange for donation money.\n29: Part of that chapter stems from a 2007 deal between Clinton Foundation board member Frank Giustra\u2019s company, UrAsia, and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company.\n30: Uranium One has mines, mills and land in U.S. states equal to about 20% of the American uranium production capacity.\n31: Its actual production, though, is a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the United States, at 11% in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.\n32: RELATED: In context: Hillary Clinton on Tulsi Gabbard, the Trump campaign, Russia In 2009, Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, bought a 17% share of Uranium One.\n33: A year later, it bought enough shares to give it a 51% stake.\n34: Since a foreign entity was taking a majority stake in a uranium operation, several U.S. government regulators had to approve the deal.\n35: They did, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100% ownership of Uranium One and renamed it Uranium One Holding.\n36: In our previous fact-check , we noted that Clinton sat on the committee that approved the sale \u2014\u00a0but the decision was not hers alone.\n37: She also did not have the power to veto the committee\u2019s decision.\n38: The Clinton Foundation \"received $150M from Russia\" This is exaggerated.\n39: We rated a similar claim Mostly False.\n40: Nine people related to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation.\n41: But the bulk of the money, about $131 million, came from Giustra \u2014 a businessman from Canada, not Russia.\n42: Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state.\n43: We haven\u2019t independently verified Giustra\u2019s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly \u2014 from $145 million to $4 million.",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of one of three House committees holding the hearings.\n3: \"I read the House rules,\" the former New Jersey judge said.\n4: \"And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors \u2014 the hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding \u2014 they are consistent with the rules.\"\n5: He\u2019s right.\n6: Impeachment 101 Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower\u2019s report suggesting that Trump withheld U.S. military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n7: A president can be impeached if his or her acts are inconsistent with their presidential duties, whether or not it violates criminal law.\n8: It is the job of the House to decide whether there\u2019s enough evidence to show that Trump committed an impeachable offense.\n9: First, articles of impeachment would have to pass the full U.S. House of Representatives with a simple majority.\n10: Those articles would then be sent to the Senate for a trial.\n11: A two-thirds Senate vote is required to convict \u2014 that is, remove \u2014 the president.\n12: Impeachment is part of the U.S. Constitution.\n13: But the rules and procedures for an impeachment are not written in the Constitution, or in a statute; they depend largely on historical precedent.\n14: Napolitano\u2019s position After making his statement on \"Fox & Friends,\" Napolitano went on to explain that the impeachment inquiry rules were adopted in 2015 by House Republicans and allow for initial interviews of witnesses to be done in secret, much like a criminal case is presented to a grand jury.\n15: Any formal impeachment hearing, he added, would have to be done in public, as would a Senate trial.\n16: When we asked a Fox News representative for information to support Napolitano\u2019s statement, she sent the following from Napolitano: \"The House rules permit committee chairs to hold closed hearings on matters of national security or intelligence.\n17: Diplomatic matters implicate both national security and intelligence.\n18: The rules also permit standing committees \u2013 as opposed to the full House \u2013 to issue subpoenas.\n19: As well, they permit interviews of witnesses in secret in order to determine if they are credible enough to present in public.\"\n20: Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky told us that according to the House of Representatives\u2019 House Practice book , \"an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges.\"\n21: And no such resolution was done in this inquiry.\n22: But the day after Napolitano\u2019s interview, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the impeachment inquiry is legal .\n23: And Napolitano\u2019s statement was not about in the inquiry generally, but whether interviews can be done in private.\n24: Experts agree with Napolitano Frank Bowman , a University of Missouri professor of law and author of \" High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump ,\" told us the hearings are not \"secret\" in that they are open to members of the three House committees (roughly 100 lawmakers), along with their staff.\n25: Bowman pointed us to the 2015 House rules that allow for the private questioning of witnesses in impeachment inquiries.\n26: The rules say House meetings shall be open to the public except when a committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, \"determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or otherwise would violate a law or rule of the House.\"\n27: Jeffrey Engel , founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University and co-author of \"Impeachment: An American History,\" underscored the House\u2019s wide latitude.\n28: He told PolitiFact that from a constitutional standpoint, \"the House can choose whatever rules it wants for impeachment hearings\u2014just as the Senate will be able to do the same for its trial, relying on precedent but not bound by it.\"\n29: One more point before we close.\n30: When Republicans controlled the House, its Benghazi committee held nearly all of its hearings behind closed doors, Allan Lichtman , American University history professor and author of \" The Case for Impeachment ,\" noted to us.\n31: He also pointed out that in the final House report on the matter, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy , a South Carolina Republican, said: \"The committee\u2019s preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned.\n32: Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery.\n33: Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person.\n34: In a hearing, every member of a committee is recognized \u2014 usually for five minutes \u2014 a procedure which precludes in-depth in-depth focused questioning.\n35: Interviews also allow the committee to safeguard the privacy of witnesses who may fear retaliation for cooperating or whose work requires anonymity, such as intelligence community operatives.\"",

        "passage": "0: Republican GayDonna Vandergriff has turned to abortion in her effort to portray Democrat Del.\n1: Schuyler VanValkenburg as \"too extreme\" for the 72nd House District in wetern Henrico County.\n2: Vandergriff recently sent voters a mailer with a colored picture of a mother nuzzling a newborn, and a black and white shot of VanValkenburg in the background.\n3: \"Did her life have value 10 minutes before she was born?\"\n4: the capitalized print asks.\n5: \"Socialist Democrat Schuyler VanValkenburg says no.\"\n6: The flip side says \"Schuyler VanValkenburg was the co-sponsor of the\u00a0Democratic bill that would have allowed abortion until\u00a0the moment of birth.\"\n7: We fact checked this statement.\n8: Vandergriff\u2019s mailer erroneously cites as its source a bill that made no mention of abortion.\n9: It would have required health insurers to cover pasteurized, donated human breast milk, which in rare instance is needed for infants.\n10: The measure never came up for a vote and died.\n11: Matt Williams, spokesman for Vandergriff\u2019s campaign, said the correct source is an unsuccessful bill that would have eased the state abortion restrictions.\n12: It was introduced in January 2019 by Del.\n13: Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax.\n14: VanValkenburg was among 21 Democratic co-sponsors .\n15: Debate focused on the bill\u2019s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would \"likely\" kill a woman or \"substantially and irremediably\" harm her mental or physical health.\n16: The legislation would have lowered the threshold of certifying physicians to one.\n17: That doctor would have to attest that the pregnancy would damage a woman\u2019s health.\n18: The \"substantial and irremediable\" test would have been repealed.\n19: Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 28\u00a0hearing, acknowledged her legislation would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating.\n20: Many Republicans claim the bill shows\u00a0Democrats support \"abortion to the time of birth.\"\n21: The bill died on a partisan 5-3 vote in a House subcommittee\u00a0VanValkenburg doesn\u2019t sit on.\n22: Third trimester abortions are extremely rare; the state Department of Health has recorded two this century.\n23: But even with failure of Tran\u2019s bill, they are legal in Virginia.\n24: The Supreme Court ruled in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision that states may prohibit an abortion after fetal viability if there are exceptions to protect the life or mental or physical health of the mother.\n25: This undercuts Vandergriff\u2019s claim that the bill would have \"allowed abortion until the moment of birth.\"\n26: That possibility already existed.\n27: Virginia law allows third-trimester abortions if three doctors certify that \"the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the dealth of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\"\n28: Tran\u2019s bill would have eased those requirements.\n29: Vandergriff is not the only candidate\u00a0misstating the bill.\n30: During the course of writing this fact-check, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, began making similar charges against her opponent, Del.\n31: Debra Rodman.\n32: Rodman also co-sponsored Tran\u2019s bill and next to Tran while she was testified in the January hearing.\n33: Dunnavant has sent a mailer saying Rodman \"proposed legalizing abortion in the ninth month.\"\n34: Dunnavant is also running a TV ad saying, \"Debra Rodman\u2019s bill would allow late-term abortions for any reason up to the moment of birth.\"",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: As flu season begins, some Instagram users are posting photos with misinformation about vaccines.\n1: In one post published Oct. 22, an account called Holistic Health & More, which has more than 165,000 followers, claimed the flu shot can lead to the death of fetuses.\n2: \"4250% increase fetal death from flu shot,\" the photo reads.\n3: \"CDC failed to tell pregnant mothers of the increase (sic) chance of miscarriage & stillbirth after receiving CDC recommended flu vaccine.\"\n4: This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n5: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook , Instagram\u2019s parent company.)\n6: It has more than 1,700 likes, and PolitiFact found several copies of the post elsewhere on the internet.\n7: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Instagram) As evidence for its claim, Holistic Health & More linked to a website called VacTruth.com, a known publisher of anti-vaccine misinformation .\n8: The site requires a password to enter, so we were not able to locate the article in question.\n9: Holistic Health & More did not respond to a message requesting more evidence.\n10: We found one study that did observe a spike in \"spontaneous abortion,\" or miscarriage, among women who had been vaccinated for the flu \u2014 but the bulk of research has found no link between the vaccine and infant mortality.\n11: Importantly, medical officials still recommend pregnant women get the flu shot because they can be more prone to severe illness from the flu, as can their babies.\n12: Where the post came from We traced the Instagram post to an anti-vaccine blog entry from November 2016.\n13: The blog, Health Freedom Idaho, is part of a libertarian movement that opposes health regulations and advocates for nontraditional care.\n14: The blog post links to a 2013 study published by the journal Human & Experimental Toxicology.\n15: It looked at miscarriages and stillbirths listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database of reported vaccine side effects maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.\n16: RELATED: No, you\u2019re not an \u2018active, live walking virus\u2019 for 2 weeks following a flu shot The study found an increase in \"fetal loss reports\" among pregnant women who received the flu shot during two consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010.\n17: (The season typically spans from fall to spring.)\n18: Approximately 587,600 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot in 2008-09, and about 2,236,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot and/or the swine flu vaccine the next year.\n19: The study noted a jump in fetal loss reports from four in 2008-09 to 174 in 2009-10.\n20: That\u2019s a 4,250% increase \u2014\u00a0but it doesn\u2019t mean you should interpret it the way this blogger did.\n21: The researchers did not prove that the flu shot was the cause of the uptick.\n22: The CDC lists several limitations of this data.\n23: The reason why it\u2019s unreliable has to do with the fact that health care providers are encouraged to report any health problems following the administration of vaccines \u2014 even if they don\u2019t believe the vaccine was the cause.\n24: \"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,\" the CDC\u2019s list of limitations reads.\n25: \"The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.\"\n26: Experts concurred with those limitations.\n27: \"The study you cite is trying to do something with VAERS data which is not valid,\" said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Public Health, in an email.\n28: \"The results of this study do not contribute to our scientific understanding of the issue.\"\n29: Other research shows no link The study cited by the Instagram post isn\u2019t the only one to link the flu shot with miscarriages.\n30: But most research shows that the vaccine is safe, and the CDC recommends it for all pregnant women so they can avoid complications caused by flu infections.\n31: One study , which was published in the journal Vaccine in September 2017, compared nearly 500 pregnant women who had miscarriages during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 flu seasons to the same number of women who had normal deliveries during the same period.\n32: Researchers found that, of the women who miscarried, 17 had received the flu shot within a month of miscarrying and also received the vaccine the year prior.\n33: However, the study\u2019s authors warned that the results did not suggest a causal link between the flu vaccine and miscarriage \u2014\u00a0and they still said pregnant women should receive the flu shot.\n34: On its website , the CDC also doubts the study\u2019s results.\n35: RELATED: Bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers The CDC says the bulk of research supports the notion that the flu shot is safe for pregnant women and that the risk of miscarriage is low.\n36: It cites several studies that have found no increased risk of miscarriage as a result of receiving the flu shot.\n37: \u2022 A 2013 study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology did not find an increased risk of pregnancy loss within four weeks of receiving the flu vaccine.\n38: \u2022 A 2014 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that, among 57,554 vaccinated and unvaccinated women, the flu vaccine did not lead to an increased or decreased risk of \"preterm birth.\"\n39: \u2022 A 2017 review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between 2010 and 2016 found no evidence to suggest a connection between the flu vaccine and pregnancy complications.\n40: \u2022 A 2017 study found that, even when it is administered during the first trimester of pregnancy, the flu vaccine was not associated with structural birth defects.\n41: In addition to the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that pregnant women receive the flu shot.\n42: \"In evaluating all of the available scientific information, there is insufficient information to support changing the current recommendation which is to offer and encourage routine flu vaccinations during pregnancy regardless of the trimester of pregnancy,\" Haywood Brown, former president of the professional association, wrote in September 2017 .",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: Vaping-related illnesses have vexed public health officials and prompted state policymakers to consider banning e-cigarettes .\n1: The Centers for Disease Control cited 1,888 reports of lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes or vaping and 37\u00a0deaths\u00a0as of Oct. 29.\n2: Those who vape use an electronic cigarette product, such as a vape pen or e-hookah, to heat a liquid to produce an aerosol that they inhale into their lungs.\n3: The liquid can contain nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid oils (CBD)\u00a0 and other substances and additives.\n4: Most electronic cigarette products contain a battery to heat the liquid.\n5: In New York, approved providers offer medical marijuana in several forms, including vape pens and cartridges, and offer THC and CBD in different concentrations, according to a 2018 report from the state Department of Health.\n6: In an interview on WBEN radio on Oct. 9, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes assured listeners that vaping medical marijuana from an approved dispensary is safe.\n7: \"If folks are vaping a legal medical cannabis product that comes from any of the New York state operators, they will not have to worry about the negative impacts on their lungs,\" Peoples-Stokes said.\n8: But is that true?\n9: We reached out to Peoples-Stokes\u2019 spokesman, Kevin Jolly, who said that the Majority Leader was following guidance from the state Department of Health.\n10: Jolly said the public health concern stems from recent cases of lung injuries from vaping products purchased informally on the street.\n11: Peoples-Stokes does not approve of vaping, he said.\n12: State urges caution The state Department of Health, however, cautions users of state-approved medical marijuana vape products, even though it has no reports of problems with them.\n13: On Sept. 7 , Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker released a statement urging \"New Yorkers to stop using vape products while the investigation into the definitive cause of reported vaping-associated illnesses nationwide can be better determined.\"\n14: That statement was also posted on the department\u2019s web page for medical marijuana users .\n15: Medical marijuana products are \"rigorously tested for contaminants, pesticides and concentration of cannabinoids,\" the department advised , but it warned that \"out of an abundance of caution, we are also urging patients in the medical marijuana program to consult with their health care providers on potential alternatives to vaping products while the investigation continues.\"\n16: There are reasons Peoples-Stokes declared regulated medical marijuana safe for New Yorkers to use.\n17: An earlier notice from the state Department of Health, dated Sept. 5, 2019, asked everyone except medical marijuana users to consider not using any vape products.\n18: And on Sept. 9, two days after the department cautioned medical marijuana users to consider alternatives to vaping, Gov.\n19: Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference about vaping illnesses that \"this does not include the medical marijuana products.\n20: Those are regulated, and those are safe.\"\n21: At the federal level, the CDC is also investigating the cause of the lung injuries and has\u00a0 recommended that no one use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC, according to Cassie Brailer, press officer for lung injury response at the CDC.\n22: The agency knows that THC is present in most of the samples that have been tested and that most lung injury patients report using products that contain THC, Brailer said.\n23: National and state findings \"suggest products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources,\" are linked to most of the cases, Brailer said.\n24: \"Since the specific cause or causes of lung injury are not yet known, the only way to assure that you are not at risk while the investigation continues is to consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette and vaping products,\" Brailer said.\n25: Mixed opinions on safety In interviews with four researchers who study public health or cannabis use, we found mixed opinions on whether vaping even a regulated substance such a medical marijuana can have a negative impact on a patient\u2019s lungs.\n26: Two experts said that it is too early to tell.\n27: One said that vaping any substance can be harmful.\n28: And one said that those vaping regulated medical marijuana in New York state should not fear the marijuana but said there are unknowns about the\u00a0vaping device itself.\n29: Mitch Earleywine, a psychology professor at the University at Albany who studies marijuana policy and advocates for reform of cannabis laws, said that flavor-free vape liquids, such as those used in the medical marijuana program in New York, remain under-investigated.\n30: He has done research on the vaporizer, which he said appears safe, but there is no long-term data on the vape oil.\n31: Ana Maria Rule, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, agreed there is not enough data to declare vaping medical marijuana \"safe.\"\n32: Another expert, Ilias Kavouras, a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, said that lung damage can be caused by medical marijuana and vaping, including those formed during the process of smoking marijuana or vaping.\n33: \"There is evidence in the scientific literature that toxic and carcinogenic species are formed during vaping,\" Kavouras said.\n34: A professor of public health at Syracuse University offered a different opinion.\n35: Dessa Bergen-Cico, who is coordinator of addiction studies programs at Falk College at SU, said that people who purchase medical marijuana vape cartridges from registered state dispensaries \"should not have problems with product safety because the products are highly regulated and tested.\"\n36: However, \"it is still unknown if there is something in the vaping devices that is a catalyst for the lung injuries,\" Bergen-Cico said.",

Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, have been kept out of the hearings not because they are Republicans, but because they are not on the relevant committees.\n18: And some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, have chosen not to attend despite being able to.\n19: There is no constitutional provision that says a president or his allies must be allowed to cross-examine witnesses during a House impeachment inquiry.\n20: \"Nothing in either the Constitution or House rules requires public hearings and/or cross-examination at this stage,\" said Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University.\n21: When Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the inquiry was denying Trump \"due process accorded every American,\" we rated his statement False .\n22: If such rights apply at all, they would be granted during the Senate\u2019s trial phase.\n23: \"The House impeachment inquiry is equivalent to a grand jury investigation in a criminal case,\" said Suzanna Sherry, professor of law at Vanderbilt University.\n24: \"And there is no opportunity for cross-examination when evidence is presented to the grand jury.\"\n25: Republicans also have the ability to ask questions of witnesses at hearings, Sherry said, which is \"more opportunity for cross-examination than is given to a target of a grand jury investigation.\"\n26: \"By any ordinary definition, that would amount to \u2018cross-examination,\u2019\" said Frank O.\n27: Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.",

        "passage": "0: Dubious medical advice is not only plentiful on social media \u2013 it\u2019s persistent.\n1: Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack.\n2: One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008 , has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: \"This was sent to us from a nurse in our district\u00a0 \u2026 thought I\u2019d pass along just as an FYI.\n3: Motrin and Robitussin don\u2019t mix!!!\n4: Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago.\n5: We\u2019ve been asked to pass this on.\n6: Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madison\u2019s age that have died recently the same way that she did.\n7: The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack.\n8: They believe this is what happened to them.\n9: They told her to alert everyone to this.\n10: \u2018Do not give children both of these medicines together.\u2019 You can give them one or the other but not both.\n11: When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator.\n12: After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator.\n13: Please pass this on !!!!!!!!!\"\n14: The bottom of the post has the email signature: \"Lisa Lopez M.A.\n15: Children\u2019s Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic.\"\n16: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n17: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n18: This rumor is just that \u2013\u2013 a rumor.\n19: There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children.\n20: The Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared.\n21: The hospital\u2019s announcement said the following: \"In 2009, a Children\u2019s employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account.\n22: Because the employee\u2019s professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n23: This is not the case.\"\n24: All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and \"parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking.\"\n25: The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their children\u2019s doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs.\n26: The Children\u2019s Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014 : \"Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees.\"\n27: The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic.\n28: It\u2019s important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications.\n29: But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined.\n30: These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin.\n31: If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings.\n32: Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children \"(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.\n33: These can be fatal.\n34: The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed.\"\n35: Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that \"use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks.\"\n36: She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of children\u2019s cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate.\n37: \"The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years,\" she said.\n38: Turney noted that it\u2019s important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications.",

the restricted version covers emergency and pregnancy-related services, and the full-scope is more comprehensive, including medical, dental and eye care.\n31: California in 2016 began offering full-scope Medi-Cal to all children under 19 years old, regardless of immigration status.\n32: This year, the state expanded full-scope Medi-Cal to adults 19 to 25 years old who are illegally in the country and meet the income requirements.\n33: In 2019-20, this expansion is expected to cost California about $98 million, with an estimated $74 million coming from the state\u2019s general fund.\n34: The state funds will support the full-scope Medi-Cal services ineligible for federal aid, Graves said.\n35: The additional funding, beyond the approximately $74 million from the state\u2019s general fund, will come from the federal government and be used to pay for emergency and pregnancy-related services, he said.\n36: \"As with the prior expansion, the general fund cost of this new expansion will be paid for with tax revenues that are generated by California\u2019s current tax system, with no tax increase,\" Graves said.\n37: Almost all tax revenue that flows into the state\u2019s general fund comes from the personal income tax, the sales and use tax, and the corporation tax, he said.\n38: The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office projected that on an ongoing basis, the Medi-Cal expansion for young adults would increase general fund spending by around $225 million annually across the Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services program.\n39: The full-scope expansion is expected to benefit about 100,000 people.\n40: Some California state lawmakers and immigrant advocates wanted to offer health coverage to all immigrants living illegally in the state, but those broader plans were curtailed during budget negotiations.\n41: California\u2019s budget has a surplus of more than $20 billion.",

        "passage": "0: California\u2019s homeless crisis now ranks as one of the top concerns in the state, tied for first with jobs and the economy in a recent survey .\n1: Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who chairs the governor\u2019s commission on homelessness, has taken notice and promised greater urgency.\n2: He recently called for his city to spend $30 million to jump-start the mass production of tiny homes, structures 500 square feet or less.\n3: Steinberg said these no-frills structures could house thousands of homeless people in Sacramento and elsewhere, and help ease the state\u2019s crisis, claiming \"90,000 Californians are unsheltered and homeless.\"\n4: That\u2019s nearly the population of medium-sized cities, from Santa Barbara to Livermore to Redding.\n5: Is the state\u2019s homeless crisis really as severe as Steinberg claimed?\n6: We set out on a fact check.\n7: Our research This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at Steinberg\u2019s statements on homelessness.\n8: In July, during his push for a statewide \u2018right to shelter\u2019 law, we examined his claims about the share of unsheltered homeless people in California compared with New York City \u2014 and on the soaring rate of homeless deaths in two major cities in the state.\n9: We found his assertions were generally correct, but needed a few clarifications.\n10: To verify Steinberg\u2019s statement about 90,000 unsheltered people, we reviewed a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development study called the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress .\n11: Housing experts consider it the most comprehensive and current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.\n12: Released in December last year, the report shows California had nearly 130,000 homeless people both sheltered and unsheltered, a tally from a point-in-time count conducted in January 2018.\n13: That was the most of any state, far ahead of second-place New York with about 92,000 homeless people.\n14: Of course, more people live in California than any other state.\n15: Of California\u2019s total, 89,543 were unsheltered, meaning they were not living in an emergency shelter or similar residence.\n16: Instead, they were found on the street, in a vehicle or abandoned building.\n17: This matches Steinberg\u2019s statement.\n18: At nearly 69 percent, California\u2019s share of unsheltered homeless people was the highest in the nation, the report found.\n19: Oregon had the second-highest share at about 62 percent.\n20: Steinberg\u2019s spokesperson said the mayor relied on the HUD report.\n21: California has the nation's highest rate of unsheltered homeless people, according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.\n22: \u2018Double digit increases\u2019 in homelessness Chris Martin, a legislative advocate on homelessness at the nonprofit Housing California, said Steinberg used the best figure available.\n23: He said a new HUD report is expected in December.\n24: Based on early survey results around the state this year, Martin said he anticipates at least a 10 percent jump in California\u2019s overall homeless population when the report comes out.\n25: He did not have an estimate on how the unsheltered population might change.\n26: \"It\u2019s bad,\" Martin said, of the overall totals.\n27: \"I\u2019d say most communities around the state are seeing a double-digit increase.\"\n28: Martin pointed to one research group, HUB for Urban Initiatives, that estimates there\u2019s been a nearly 24 percent spike in homelessness statewide from 2017 to 2019.\n29: He noted that the federal homeless counts represent a snapshot-in-time of a community\u2019s homeless population.\n30: \"We usually estimate that two to three times the point-in-time number are homeless during the course of the year,\" added Sharon Rapport, director of the California State Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, develops housing policy and makes housing loans.\n31: While the federal reports are issued each year, Rapport said the odd year counts are more comprehensive because not every jurisdiction did a survey in 2018.\n32: She said she expects the 2019 report to show a larger overall number of homeless people.\n33: \"Despite these flaws, it is the best data we have at this point,\" Rapport added.",

        "passage": "0: It\u2019s not uncommon for CEOs of top corporations to give speeches.\n1: It is uncommon for them to make the African American incarceration rate the focus of those speeches.\n2: Yet, that\u2019s what American Family CEO Jack Salzwedel did Oct. 8, 2019 , at an event honoring the Deloitte Wisconsin 75, a list of the top privately and closely held companies in the state.\n3: Madison-based American Family is fourth on the list, with revenue of about $10.2 billion in 2018.\n4: \"There\u2019s more African American males in the penal system right now than there were at the height of slavery,\" Salzwedel said.\n5: \"And it\u2019s something that needs to be addressed because as a business this is an important issue for us, not just as a feel good.\n6: This is an important issue for us we think about our markets, demand for our products, the workforce, all of these things.\"\n7: Salzwedel acknowledged that his speech could be controversial, adding: \"I truly believe that if people will be looking back 50 years from now at this time right now, that they\u2019ll look at what\u2019s going on with the mass incarceration movement right now and they'll look at us the same way we look back 100 years and look at slavery.\"\n8: Salzwedel\u2019s entire statement is interesting, but we decided to focus on the imprisoned-enslaved comparison.\n9: Is he right that there are \"more African American males in the penal system right now than there were (enslaved) at the height of slavery\"?\n10: The background The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on Jan. 31, 1865, declaring , \"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\n11: Although slavery was abolished in the 19th Century, the long-term ramifications of the practice, which persisted for three centuries, continues to reverberate in public discourse, classrooms and even amongst the highest levels of corporate America.\n12: For instance, the board of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce has identified \"racial disparity/inequity\" as the region\u2019s top liability.\n13: \"Business leaders are by nature forward looking -- they can see that to be successful we need to be a region of choice for all-inclusive of diverse talent,\" said Tim Sheehy, MMAC president.\n14: On Sept. 26, 2019, the MMAC announced that 65 employers with 130,000 workers had signed a pledge to increase the diversity of their managers and workforce.\n15: Those companies included Harley-Davidson, MillerCoors, the Milwaukee Bucks and Johnson Controls.\n16: \"AmFam was not approached in the original outreach as their corporate footprint is relatively small in Milwaukee -- though that will be changing,\" Sheehy said.\n17: \"They are very supportive.\"\n18: Now, what about Salzwedel\u2019s incarceration vs. enslavement claim?\n19: The evidence When asked to provide backup, American Family spokesman Ken Muth pointed us to \" The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness ,\" a 2010 book by civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander.\n20: In the introduction to the book, the author writes \"we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.\"\n21: Alexander goes on to say : \"More African American adults are under correctional control today\u2014in prison or jail, on probation or parole \u2014 than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.\"\n22: As evidence, though, that quote simply mirrors what Salzwedel said.\n23: What about the numbers?\n24: In 2014, PolitiFact Rhode Island fact-checked a similar claim : \"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.\"\n25: That item noted: \"The U.S. Census Bureau records for 1850 showed that 872,924 male African American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time.\n26: (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and \"free coloreds\" was 23.2 million.)\"\n27: Meanwhile, federal Bureau of Justice statistics statistics showed about 1.68 million African American men were under state and federal criminal justice supervision.\n28: Salzwedel\u2019s statement was worded a bit differently, in that it referred broadly to the \"penal system.\"\n29: When taken broadly, we think that takes in those on probation and parole, as well as those in the nation\u2019s local jails.\n30: The latest available nationwide data on parole and probation is from 2016, so we\u2019ll zoom in there.\n31: At the end of 2016, there were 487,300 black men serving time in state or federal prison and about 200,000 serving time in local jails, according to the BJS report \" Jail Inmates in 2016 .\"\n32: The agency also recorded 771,355 on probation and 289,000 on parole.\n33: That means about 1.75 million black men were under federal, state and local criminal justice supervision.\n34: That is about double the 872,924 black men who were enslaved in 1850.\n35: Considering population growth Of course, the nation\u2019s population has grown a lot since 1850.\n36: Indeed, there are far more black residents in the United States now \u2014 about 40 million -- than the 23.2 million total residents in 1850.\n37: In 2016, the total U.S. population stood at 308,745,538 .\n38: By that comparison, black enslaved males tallied 3.7% of the population in 1850, while\u00a0 African American males imprisoned today represent about 0.6% of the population.\n39: Reggie Jackson, head griot/docent at America\u2019s Black Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee and a consultant at Nurturing Diversity Partners, also pointed to the issue of population growth \"Obviously, there are over 10 times more blacks today than there were then, so it would only make sense that more are incarcerated now,\" Jackson said in an email.",

Dick Sears, D-Bennington, last week.\n15: Nikki Eaves, an Energizer spokesperson, offered a similar explanation to the Bennington Banner, saying that the facility in Wisconsin is equipped to handle the company\u2019s hearing aid production.\n16: \"As part of the integration,\" she said, \"we reviewed our combined manufacturing footprint and determined the total demand for specialty batteries can be produced more efficiently in one facility.\"\n17: The company did not respond to questions from VTDigger about whether the state\u2019s business climate contributed to its decision to leave the state.\n18: But Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for Scott, said that it was \"self-evident\" that Energizer is moving out of state because Vermont\u2019s business environment isn\u2019t competitive.\n19: She said that if it was \"advantageous\" for Energizer to ramp up its production in Vermont, the company would have kept operations here.\n20: Kelley pointed to the fact that Vermont has among the highest power costs in the nation and some of the highest corporate and property taxes, according to the Tax Foundation\u2019s latest business tax climate index .\n21: In 2018, Forbes ranked Vermont 47th in its U.S. \"Best for Business\" rankings and said that the cost of doing business in the state is 12% higher than the national average.\n22: \"Businesses are going to do what\u2019s in the best interest of the business,\" Kelley said.\n23: \"If their decision is to leave the state for another state, that indicates it is more advantageous and more competitive in that other state.\"\n24: Kelly did not, however, provide any additional evidence that Vermont\u2019s business climate contributed to Energizer\u2019s factory consolidation.\n25: Sears, the senator from Bennington, said it would be hard to evaluate whether the governor\u2019s statement is true, unless the company provided more information about its decision.\n26: \"I think it\u2019s unclear what the reasons are for them not investing in Vermont,\" he said.\n27: \"You can generalize and say it\u2019s anti-business and Wisconsin\u2019s more business-friendly.\n28: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not.\"\n29: The senator said he couldn\u2019t recall the company lobbying legislators on business issues in the Statehouse, except on one occasion.\n30: About a decade ago, when Vermont banned mercury in batteries, the company asked lawmakers for a period of time to phase-out use of the chemical instead of an immediate ban.\n31: Sears said he worked to get that language written into the bill.\n32: Kelley said the governor\u2019s office was seeking more information from Energizer about its reasons for leaving Vermont.\n33: Sen. Brian Campion, D-Bennington, said Scott should have that conversation with Energizer before he \"speculates\" on its motivations.\n34: \"I think it\u2019s important to hear directly from Energizer on what kind of things would have or even could keep them here,\" Campion said, noting that the company doesn\u2019t plan to fully shutter its doors in Bennington until 2021.\n35: \"Are there things that could be done between now and then that could keep Energizer here?\"",

Steve Scalise , R-La., who tweeted , \"Bernie Sanders said YOUR tax dollars should be used to fund abortions in foreign countries to reduce population size.\"\n26: Sanders did say population control should be part of addressing climate change.\n27: And he brought up the Mexico City agreement and said women should have the right to \"reproductive decisions.\"\n28: But he did not explicitly promote the use of abortion for population control.",

Don Gaetz.\n14: Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph.\n15: Anglin reported that Gaetz\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car and smelled of alcohol.\n16: Gaetz, a lawyer, admitted he had consumed two beers but declined field sobriety tests.\n17: He was arrested and refused the breath test.\n18: We did not find evidence that Gaetz\u2019s father Don \"got him off\" of the arrest, as the post says.\n19: The prosecutor at the time asked to be removed from Gaetz\u2019s case, saying his stepson was friends with Matt Gaetz.\n20: The case was then assigned to Steve Meadows, a prosecutor in a neighboring circuit.\n21: Gaetz\u2019s lawyer filed a motion to drop the case.\n22: The prosecutor agreed to drop the case in December 2008, court records show .\n23: We searched Gaetz\u2019s name on Nexis and did not find any other DUI arrests.\n24: Florida Department of Law Enforcement records note only one arrest for Gaetz, in October 2008, related to a DUI misdemeanor traffic offense.\n25: Snopes , which debunked a meme about Gaetz\u2019s DUI record in July, found that the earliest version of the claim stemmed from a 2016 post by a conspiracy theorist .\n26: Vitas fraud case didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz The Facebook post goes on to say \"he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud.\"\n27: That leaves the impression that \"he\" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong.\n28: It was Don Gaetz\u2019s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud.\n29: It didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz, and the elder Gaetz was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n30: In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services.\n31: The government accused the company of engaging in Medicare fraud between 2002 and 2013.\n32: At the time the lawsuit was announced, Don Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he remained active in the management of Vitas until 2000.\n33: Then Gaetz stepped aside when he was elected superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District.\n34: \"I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year,\" Gaetz told the newspaper.\n35: Don Gaetz sold Vitas in 2004 to Chemed.\n36: He was elected to the Senate in 2006.\n37: Gaetz was not named as a defendant and denied wrongdoing .\n38: In 2017, the government settled the case for $75 million .",

        "passage": "0: Republicans explained their party-line vote against the Democrats\u2019 impeachment process resolution on the grounds that it isn\u2019t fair.\n1: Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the House should have stuck with the rules in place for Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n2: \"Today\u2019s resolution provides fewer due process protections and fewer protections for minority rights than what we have seen in previous impeachment efforts,\" Cole said Oct. 31 on the House floor .\n3: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He listed three differences.\n4: 1\n5: The \"resolution does not provide for a co-equal subpoena power.\"\n6: 2\n7: It doesn\u2019t guarantee \"all members the right to fully access committee records.\"\n8: 3\n9: Presidential participation in hearings by the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees \"was granted to President Clinton in 1998, yet it is not present here.\"\n10: We wanted to know if Cole\u2019s impeachment history was correct.\n11: (A separate fact-check examines Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s claim that the Republicans have more power than in the past impeachments.)\n12: Warning: This stuff can make baseball rules look simple.\n13: Point No.\n14: 1: Subpoena powers Cole is partially correct that Republicans have less power on paper to block Democratic witnesses.\n15: But in terms of calling their own witnesses, Republicans are no worse off than they were in the past.\n16: And practically speaking, they never had much power to stop the Democrats from doing what they liked.\n17: During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, the majority and minority parties could seek subpoenas, and both of them could lodge an objection to the other\u2019s request.\n18: The text of the rules for both the Nixon and Clinton hearings was the same (bold emphasis is ours): The power to issue a subpoena \"may be exercised by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting alone, except that in the event either so declines, either shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision the question whether such authority shall be so exercised.\"\n19: Of course, if it came to a committee vote, by definition, the majority has the votes to win.\n20: In contrast, the rule approved for the Trump impeachment effectively says the Democrats can object to a Republican request, but the Republicans can\u2019t object to a Democratic one.\n21: It gives the minority the chance to request a subpoena, but \" in the case that the chair declines to concur in a proposed action of the ranking minority member,\" the matter goes to committee vote.\n22: The business of \"either shall have the right\" is missing in the current rules.\n23: \"Under the Clinton and Nixon rules, it was symmetrical,\" said Stanford law professor Dave Alan Sklansky.\n24: \"Now there\u2019s an asymmetry.\"\n25: But again, both then and now, if it comes to a committee vote, the majority will get what it wants.\n26: And for the witnesses Republicans want, they face the same potential hurdle they faced back in 1974 and 1998.\n27: Cole leaves out a piece of history: Republicans changed the starting point in 2015 when they held the House and planned to investigate the Obama administration.\n28: The rules they passed Jan. 6, 2015 , gave committee chairs the full authority to subpoena someone.\n29: The most the minority could expect was to be \"consulted.\"\n30: At the time, Democrats complained bitterly.\n31: Point No.\n32: 2: Access to records Cole misrepresents the issue of member access to materials in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and he\u2019s wrong about what took place in the Nixon investigation.\n33: He said the resolution doesn\u2019t \"guarantee\" that all members have access to hearing materials.\n34: But his staff could point to no document or statement from the Democrats that denied access.\n35: His office told us \"the concern is that current chairmen are not respecting\" standing House rules.\n36: The Democratic materials say nothing about this one way or the other.\n37: Compared with the Nixon process , lawmakers imposed strict limits on who could see what.\n38: The procedures for handling impeachment inquiry materials \"limited access to such materials to the chairman, ranking minority member, special counsel, and special counsel to the minority of the committee.\"\n39: Point No.\n40: 3: Participation by the president and his counsel Cole muddies the roles of different committees.\n41: His full words on this point are: \"We offered an amendment that would require the chairman of the Rules Committee to promulgate procedures to allow for the participation of the president and his counsel in proceedings of the Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee or Foreign Affairs Committee.\n42: This right was granted to President Clinton in 1998, yet it is not present here.\"\n43: The statement about Clinton is factually wrong, because none of those committees played a role in the Clinton impeachment .\n44: As in the Nixon proceedings, the House Judiciary Committee handled everything.\n45: Clinton\u2019s lawyers did participate in the Judiciary Committee process, and the House resolution gives Trump\u2019s lawyers the same rights for that committee.\n46: However, Cole has a point that Trump\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t participate in the House committees currently investigating the president, most importantly, the Select Intelligence Committee.\n47: Easy comparisons quickly break down.\n48: Most clearly in the Clinton case, the White House had zero opportunity to participate as Independent Counsel Kennth Star investigated Clinton.\n49: The investigation took place outside the House.\n50: In the Trump investigation, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee can call witnesses and ask questions.\n51: They don\u2019t have the same powers as the majority, but they have the right to participate and represent Trump\u2019s interests.\n52: Once it gets to the Judiciary Committee, the House resolution grants Trump and his lawyers more rights than Clinton or Nixon enjoyed.",

Tom Cole, R-Okla. On paper, that\u2019s somewhat accurate.\n22: In 1974 and 1998 , members of both parties could call witnesses.\n23: Either side could object to a witness, in which case, the dispute would ultimately be resolved by committee vote.\n24: Today, the Republicans lack the power to challenge a Democratic subpoena.\n25: The practical impact is less telling, because in the past as in the present, the majority party always has the votes to win at the committee level.\n26: Effectively, members of the minority party, then and now, have less subpoena power than the majority.\n27: It\u2019s worth noting that bipartisanship was in force during the Nixon impeachment, and these issues were not so contentious.\n28: The House resolution to start the inquiry passed 410 to 4 .\n29: The Trump investigation resolution passed 232 to 196.\n30: The starting point changed Sarah Binder at George Washington University said that the rules for calling witnesses, and thus the power to shape an inquiry, \"changed markedly\" since the Clinton hearings.\n31: In 2015, Republicans rewrote the standing House rules and gave committee chairs the automatic right to subpoena witnesses.\n32: The most that would be needed would be to consult with the minority, not win their approval.\n33: Binder said, \"it would be a bit eye opening\" if Democrats today rolled back the authority the Republicans established.\n34: The House, she said, has always been run by the majority.\n35: \"It's long been the nature of the beast,\" she said.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: CNN commentator Mike Shields took aim at House Democrats during a recent on-air panel, claiming they have spent more time pursuing President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment than legislating.\n1: \"The Democrats are frittering away their majority,\" said Shields, the former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee and founder of the communications firm Convergence Media, in an Oct. 31 appearance on CNN .\n2: \"They have issued more subpoenas than they\u2019ve passed bills.\"\n3: Shields\u2019 claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among conservative pundits and Republican lawmakers as the House continues its probe into Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine.\n4: The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times , which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws.\n5: But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed.\n6: In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump\u2019s desk.\n7: When we reached out to Shields, he said he \"misspoke,\" and he later clarified his point on Twitter .\n8: \"I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,\" he told us.\n9: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Even this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however.\n10: Experts said it\u2019s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation.\n11: Counting House-backed laws can be misleading The Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article\u2019s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry.\n12: The report\u2019s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported.\n13: By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n14: Pelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued approximately 47 in total, adding that many were due to \"stonewalling of the current administration and Trump\u2019s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas.\"\n15: Etienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas .\n16: The Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 46 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January.\n17: According to Congress.gov , that\u2019s accurate: There are 43 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump.\n18: But Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us , a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate.\n19: That\u2019s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions.\n20: \"But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,\" Tauberer said.\n21: Not only that, but the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning \"the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,\" he said.\n22: This year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 66 bills that earned Trump\u2019s signature, according to Congress.gov .\n23: But Tauberer said Pelosi\u2019s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new law and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.\n24: The House can\u2019t make laws by itself Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate\u2019s role in sending House-backed bills to the president\u2019s desk.\n25: \"The House can't pass \u2018bills into law\u2019 by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.\n26: According to Congress.gov , the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January.\n27: But the Senate hasn\u2019t acted on many of them.\n28: In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats\u2019 progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to \"think of me as the grim reaper.\"\n29: The GOP doesn\u2019t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.\n30: \"We are talking about two completely different processes,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank.\n31: \"A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law.\n32: The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount.\"\n33: Of course, Shields\u2019 botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn\u2019t true.",

        "passage": "0: Speaking about a recent federal advisory on marijuana, Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, put a new spin on long-standing admonitions about the drug.\n1: \"Marijuana has a unique impact on the developing brain.\n2: It can prime your brain for addiction to other substances,\" Adams said at a substance abuse conference sponsored by Oxford House , a recovery center network.\n3: This is a reiteration of the old \"gateway\" argument: the idea that marijuana is frequently an entree to using other, harder drugs.\n4: And the surgeon general\u2019s emphasis comes just as many states are loosening restrictions around its medicinal and adult recreational use .\n5: But marijuana research is limited, and this particular hypothesis is fairly controversial.\n6: We decided to put Adams\u2019 claim to the test.\n7: Is his central thesis \u2013\u00a0 marijuana has a \"unique impact\" on developing brains and can \"prime your brain for addiction\" \u2013 accurate?\n8: We contacted the surgeon general\u2019s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n9: NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don\u2019t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact.\n10: But the surgeon general\u2019s office was also unequivocal on a related point: \"From a public health perspective, no amount of drug use is safe for the developing brain.\"\n11: So how fair is Adams\u2019 statement?\n12: When we interviewed experts, the responses were all over the map \u2013 reflecting just how contested this issue is and how difficult it is to speak definitively about marijuana\u2019s impact.\n13: The gateway effect?\n14: The idea that marijuana can \"prime your brain for addiction\" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents.\n15: There are findings to suggest that early exposure to the drug may \"sensitize animals to the effects of other drugs,\" noted Joshua Isen, an assistant professor at the University of South Alabama, who researches adolescent marijuana use.\n16: For instance, Adams\u2019 office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive compound \u2013\u00a0 during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood.\n17: In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains\u2019 reward system \u2013 in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids.\n18: But, Isen said, it\u2019s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human.\n19: Ethical considerations about human research make it more or less impossible to do a randomized controlled trial \u2013 the gold standard of scientific research \u2013 that would measure how marijuana does or doesn\u2019t affect a still-developing brain.\n20: \"We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general\u2019s claim,\" Isen argued.\n21: Other experts suggested otherwise, saying that since animal research is the best we can get, it\u2019s worth taking seriously \u2013 and it is fairly conclusive.\n22: Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is \"very clear\" when it comes to marijuana\u2019s neurological impact.\n23: He called it a fair basis for the surgeon general\u2019s warning.\n24: \"What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,\" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director.\n25: But how meaningful of a risk \u2013 and how it compares to other drugs \u2013 is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research.\n26: Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction.\n27: As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: \"I don\u2019t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way.\"\n28: What about uniqueness?\n29: In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a \"unique\" effect on the brain.\n30: It elicits a response from what are called \"endocannabinoid receptors.\"\n31: Other drugs don\u2019t \u2013 they interact with different brain receptors.\n32: So, certainly, marijuana affects development using a different (or \"unique\") neurological mechanism than the ones used by, say, nicotine or alcohol.\n33: And, as best as science can tell us, marijuana harms developing brains, both Weiss and Sisley said.\n34: From a common sense, public health perspective, young people in particular should be exceptionally cautious when it comes to using the drug.\n35: But \u2013 and this is important context \u2013 marijuana is not the only substance that has this potential \"priming\" for subsequent addiction.\n36: The surgeon general\u2019s office acknowledged this finding when we asked follow-up questions.\n37: That same context, though, is missing from Adams\u2019 public statement.\n38: \"It seems that early exposure to many substances can make it likely someone will be addicted to other substances,\" Weiss said.\n39: She acknowledged that rodent studies do also suggest nicotine may have a priming effect, albeit via a different neurological route.\n40: On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, \"there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol.\"",

W. Bush.\n35: Buttigieg\u2019s campaign acknowledged that Dukakis was unsuccessful in his bid for the White House even though he had not spent time in Washington.\n36: But Buttigieg didn\u2019t say Democrats won every time they nominated someone who was not from Washington, said Chris Meagher, Buttigieg\u2019s national press secretary.\n37: \"He said every time we have won, it's been someone new on the scene,\" Meagher said.\n38: \"And every time we've put forward the most Washington-oriented, we have come up short.\"\n39: \u2018The most Washington-oriented candidate\u2019 Other Democratic nominees in the last 50 years who spent years in Washington and failed to win the presidency included senators and vice presidents.\n40: Those presidential candidates were U.S. Sen. George McGovern (lost in 1972); former vice president Walter Mondale (lost in 1984); vice president Al Gore (lost in 2000); U.S. Sen. John Kerry (lost in 2004); and former U.S. Sen. and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton (lost in 2016).\n41: Does a Democratic presidential candidate have more chances of winning if he or she is new on the national scene?\n42: \"Frankly, there have been too few modern Democratic nominees to really test any specific claims about candidate age or 'outsider-status' on a candidate's chance of winning,\" said Dominguez, the professor at the University of San Diego.\n43: \"Thinking about the voters, one would have to look at initial poll standing to get a sense of how new each of these candidates was to the voters at large,\" Dominguez said.\n44: For example, while Kerry had a long career in the Senate, it\u2019s not clear how well known he was to the national electorate.\n45: Based on analysis of voter behavior, Dominguez said, \"candidate qualities do not seem to be the main driver of voter decision-making in the general election.\"\n46: \"Outsider candidates tend to be younger than establishment candidates,\" Burden said.\n47: \"But it is not clear if hailing from outside the Washington system is what matters or representing a different generational perspective.\"",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: For the third time in the last 50 years, Congress is taking steps toward impeaching the president.\n1: Democrats had long talked about impeachment over a variety of matters, but did not launch proceedings until a whistleblower report raised concerns over Trump seeking a Ukrainian investigation of Joe Biden, a key rival in the 2020 presidential race.\n2: The first vote on impeachment came\u00a0Oct. 31, 2019, when the U.S. House of Representatives established rules for how the process would proceed.\n3: The measure passed 232 to 196 over unanimous Republican opposition.\n4: The move drew an expected array of criticism from Republicans.\n5: A freshman lawmaker from Wisconsin zeroed in on the protections given to Trump.\n6: \"Today\u2019s resolution does not provide the president with due process protections that were afforded to both President Clinton and President Nixon,\" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil , R-Janesville, said in a tweet the day the rules passed.\n7: He was far from the only person to compare the Trump push to past impeachment proceedings, which makes this a good time for a history lesson.\n8: Did past presidents get impeachment protections that Democrats are refusing to afford Trump?\n9: The background The impeachment process is complex, and the committee procedures used change a bit each time it is used, but there are two basic elements.\n10: The House\u00a0investigates the president and decides whether to issue formal articles of impeachment (similar to the role of police and prosecutor in the criminal justice system).\n11: Those charges then go to the U.S. Senate, which decides whether to convict (similar to a jury).\n12: Steil is comparing Trump to the last two presidents to face impeachment.\n13: Bill Clinton was impeached by the House\u00a0in 1998, formally accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of his affair with a 22-year-old White House intern.\n14: Clinton served out his term when the U.S. Senate ultimately acquitted him.\n15: Richard Nixon was not actually impeached .\n16: The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in July 1974 and sent them to the full House for consideration.\n17: But Nixon resigned in August 1974 after the Supreme Court forced him to release incriminating White House tapes, leaving office before the House could vote.\n18: The only other president to be impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868, amid a showdown with Congress over appointments for Secretary of War.\n19: The Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction, so Johnson served out his term.\n20: In Trump\u2019s case, rules passed by the House split the impeachment responsibilities between the Intelligence and Judiciary committees.\n21: The Intelligence Committee conducts the investigation, while the Judiciary then assesses whether those findings add up to an impeachable offense.\n22: Sally Fox, a Steil spokeswoman, acknowledged the due process protections laid out for Trump before the Judiciary are \"similar\" to those afforded Nixon and Clinton.\n23: But she pointed to two elements that she said supported Steil\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s protections are diminished.\n24: 1) Though Trump and his attorneys can see and question witnesses before the Judiciary Committee, he is not able to do so for the Intelligence Committee proceedings.\n25: Fox said this is troubling to Steil since the Intelligence Committee isn\u2019t required to transmit all material to the Judiciary Committee, so Trump will only see information that is forwarded for the Judiciary to use in making its decision.\n26: 2) The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is given the power to eliminate Trump\u2019s due process protections if the president is deemed uncooperative.\n27: We\u2019ll examine those one at a time.\n28: Impeachment process unique to Trump Steil is objecting to Trump not having the same protections before the Intelligence Committee that past presidents had before impeachment committees, but experts say this is the first time a House committee has filled such an investigative role.\n29: \"It doesn't make sense to say that President Clinton and President Nixon were given those opportunities in that parallel stage of those impeachment inquiries, because there wasn't any preliminary hearing before another committee in those inquiries,\" Stanford law professor Dave Sklansky said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n30: \"The closest analogy in the Clinton impeachment proceedings to what the House Intelligence Committee is now doing was the work of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the federal grand jury he convened.\"\n31: And Clinton, of course, did not participate in Starr\u2019s investigation, which took place outside the House.\n32: Just as Nixon wasn\u2019t involved in the investigation preceding his impeachment proceedings.\n33: Sarah Binder , professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institute, called it an apples and oranges comparison.\n34: \"I think it's fair to think of the (Intelligence Committee) investigation as the rough equivalent to those behind-closed-door Clinton and Nixon investigations,\" Binder said in an email.\n35: In other words, those presidents didn\u2019t have any due process protections at that stage that are now withheld from Trump.\n36: On Trump and due process Steil\u2019s team is correct that the ability to punish Trump for a lack of cooperation is novel, Binder said.\n37: Here\u2019s the description of that point from the Congressional Record : Should the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony to, or to produce documents requested by, the investigative committees ... the chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.\n38: But Binder questioned whether it\u2019s fair to summarize that as not having due process protections.\n39: \"It doesn't per se mean \u2026 that President Trump has fewer procedural protections than did his predecessors,\" Binder said in an email.\n40: \"It does mean that should the president fail to cooperate, he could be penalized by the committee for such behavior.\"\n41: Experts also question whether it\u2019s reasonable to refer to any of Trump\u2019s protections during the House proceedings as \"due process.\"\n42: Here\u2019s the breakdown from PolitiFact National.\n43: They rated as False a claim from Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that Trump was being denied \"due process accorded every American.\"\n44: Graham\u2019s claim that Trump has been denied due process \u2014 a claim he has repeated on Twitter and in Congress \u2014 does not square with the law or the way impeachment works.\n45: If such rights apply at all, they would be granted to Trump during the trial phase, which the Constitution says takes place in the Senate.\n46: The House\u2019s job is to determine whether there\u2019s enough evidence to show that the president committed an impeachable offense.\n47: \"It is only after charges have been filed and the case has reached the trial stage that criminal defendants have the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, have access to evidence, and have counsel present,\" said former federal prosecutor and Stanford Law professor David Sklansky, adding that the due process complaint is \"not a good argument.\"\n48: Writing for Reason , Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said due process rights are protected in \"situations where an individual stands to lose her \u2018life, liberty, or property,\u2019 none of which is at risk here.\"\n49: The Constitution says that the House \"shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\" and the Senate \"shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\"",

Speaking at a rally in Tupelo, Miss., on Nov. 1, Trump recounted how Georgia Republican Brian Kemp beat Abrams in the 2018 race for governor.\n2: \"Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote.\n3: Do you believe this?\"\n4: Trump asked .\n5: Trump, who has made multiple inaccurate statements about noncitizens voting , then pivoted to a broad attack on Democrats wanting to give immigrants in the country illegally free health care and even \"more advantages than our own military has.\"\n6: (See a related fact-check .)\n7: Trump\u2019s attack on Abrams does not reflect her position.\n8: Other iterations of the attack by Trump and Kemp were deemed \"misleading, \" a \"distortion\" or \"wrong\" in fact-checks by journalists since last year.\n9: The gist of the fact-check: Abrams mentioned undocumented immigrants in a long list of groups that made up the \"blue wave\" supporting her campaign, but she never asked anyone ineligible to vote to cast a ballot.\n10: Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections, but they can vote in some local elections in a few jurisdictions.\n11: When asked by a reporter earlier this year during a discussion of municipal voting rights if she would support noncitizens voting in some cases, Abrams made a distinction between municipal elections and federal elections, and she said she wasn't arguing for it but \"wouldn\u2019t oppose it.\"\n12: What Abrams said about undocumented immigrants in 2018 The Trump campaign pointed to a comment Abrams made Oct. 9, 2018, in front of supporters at a campaign event.\n13: Abrams was speaking about the diversity of the \"blue wave,\" referring to a groundswell of Democratic voters.\n14: Abrams said: \"The blue wave is African American.\n15: It\u2019s white, it\u2019s Latino, it\u2019s Asian, Pacific Islander.\n16: It is disabled.\n17: It is differently abled.\n18: It is LGBTQ.\n19: It is law enforcement.\n20: It is veterans.\n21: It is made up of those who have been told they are not worthy of being here.\n22: It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented.\n23: It is made up of those who have been told they\u2019re successful and those that have been told they are left behind.\n24: But the real wave is when we come together and we tell Georgia we are here and we are not going anywhere.\"\n25: Abrams didn\u2019t actually say she wanted undocumented immigrants to cast ballots for her, which would have been illegal.\n26: A few days later, a clip of Abrams\u2019 comments was publicized by the Washington Free Beacon and then spread to other media .\n27: Over the next few weeks, Abrams and her campaign argued she wasn\u2019t calling for ineligible voters to cast ballots.\n28: \"I've never once argued for anyone who is not legally allowed to vote in the state of Georgia to be allowed to vote,\" Abrams said .\n29: \"What I said that day is that this is a state that should be looking out for everyone in our state, and I would hope that anyone running for governor should believe in all of Georgia.\"\n30: Kemp pounced on her comments in an interview on Fox News and later said during a debate that Abrams had \"called on illegals\" to vote for her.\n31: Abrams disputed his characterization and criticized the state\u2019s \"exact match\" law that placed the registrations of tens of thousands of voters on hold, largely of African Americans.\n32: \"I am one of the foremost experts in the state on expansion of voting rights,\" she said.\n33: \"I have never in my life asked for anyone who was not legally eligible to vote to be able to cast a ballot.\"\n34: A spokeswoman for Abrams\u2019 organization, Fair Fight Action, told PolitiFact that Abrams was referring to the resistance against Trump, including his administration\u2019s policies on immigration.\n35: \"Undocumented people are a part of that resistance, because they deserve human dignity that Donald Trump is trying to take away,\" said spokesman Seth Bringman.\n36: 'Wouldn't oppose'\u00a0voting by noncitizens in some cases The Trump campaign also pointed to comments Abrams made in January 2019 during an interview on PBS when she was asked about her view on cities allowing some noncitizens to vote in local elections.\n37: Abrams sounded open to the reasons for a noncitizen voting in a local election but said she was \"not arguing for it or against it.\"\n38: \"I think there\u2019s a difference between municipal and state and federal,\" she said.\n39: \"Part of municipality \u2014 I\u2019m not arguing for it or against it, but I will say, having been deputy city attorney, there\u2019s a very \u2014 the granularity of what cities decide is so specific, as to, I think, allow for people to be participants in the process without it somehow undermining our larger democratic ethic that says that you should be a citizen to be a part of the conversation.\"\n40: The reporter followed up: \"So, in some cases, you would be supportive of noncitizens voting?\"\n41: \"I wouldn\u2019t be \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t oppose it,\" Abrams said.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: Democrats say President Trump\u2019s border wall has raided North Carolina of $80 million for military projects with the support of the state\u2019s Republican senator Thom Tillis.\n1: Trump decided the money was needed because, contrary to his stump speech rallying cry, Mexico won\u2019t foot the bill for the wall.\n2: Instead, the funds will come from military construction projects across the United States and abroad.\n3: Trump gained access to those funds after declaring a national emergency at the southern border.\n4: Congress has voted twice \u2014 first in March and then in late September \u2014 to block the emergency declaration.\n5: But both times, Democrats were unable to secure a two-thirds majority and Trump vetoed the measures.\n6: After the most recent vote, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called out Tillis, who voted against blocking the president\u2019s emergency declaration.\n7: The DSCC\u2019s tweet said, \"Thom Tillis yet again voted to support Trump\u2019s irresponsible emergency declaration \u2014 even though he knows it will allow the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina.\n8: Tillis\u2019 vote is putting military communities in harm\u2019s way.\"\n9: We wondered if it\u2019s true that Tillis supported the emergency declaration and whether North Carolina actually stands to lose $80 million.\n10: Trump used the National Emergencies Act to secure border wall funding During the 2016 campaign, President Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border and have Mexico pay for it.\n11: When Congress reached a stalemate over funding border security, Trump decided to act on his own.\n12: He declared a national emergency at the southern border, an initial step toward building the wall.\n13: He acted under the National Emergencies Act , which authorizes the administration to \"undertake military construction projects \u2026 not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"\n14: The move angered some members of Congress who believed that Trump was abusing the National Emergencies Act.\n15: Tillis even wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post that said the emergency declaration \"was not the right answer.\"\n16: But when Congress voted to overturn the emergency declaration in March, Tillis sided with Trump.\n17: He voted to uphold the president\u2019s action both times .\n18: (The reversal earned Tillis a Full Flop on PolitiFact\u2019s Flip-O-Meter.)\n19: On the Senate floor , he explained that he did not take issue with Trump\u2019s action, but instead was concerned that the National Emergencies Act gives future presidents too much power.\n20: \"My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses.\n21: I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order.\n22: That\u2019s why I voiced it,\" Tillis said.\n23: \"But I\u2019m sympathetic to what he was trying to do \u2026 and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here.\"\n24: Tillis is a co-sponsor of the Article One Act, which was introduced days before the March vote and would automatically end emergency declarations after 30 days.\n25: The measure has stalled in the Senate since then.\n26: But in the meantime, Tillis is supporting Trump\u2019s decision to divert funding from military bases around the world.\n27: The National Emergencies Act requires the money for the wall come from other military construction projects that have been appropriated, but not obligated, by Congress.\n28: That means the administration has to take money from dozens of projects, such as a fire and crash rescue station at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, a dining facility at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and a small arms range at Truax Field in Wisconsin.\n29: NC to lose $80 million The Pentagon listed each project affected by the national emergency at the southern border.\n30: It includes four at North Carolina military bases, and they do in fact total $80 million as the DSCC claims.\n31: The North Carolina projects are a new battalion complex and ambulatory care center at Camp Lejeune, an elementary school at Fort Bragg, and a tanker storage facility at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.\n32: None of the projects were scheduled to break ground until 2020.\n33: But while the DSCC\u2019s statement is accurate, there\u2019s an important caveat.\n34: Almost $33 million of the $80 million would have been reallocated anyway because the $32.9 million Fort Bragg school project had already been canceled \"due to declining enrollment.\"\n35: The construction of the school would have been canceled regardless of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and its funding could have been reallocated to other projects in North Carolina or elsewhere.\n36: (Fort Bragg has several urgent needs , including a $21 million fire station.)\n37: In a September town hall , Tillis acknowledged the $80 million shift in funding but said, \"Half of that was for a project at Fort Bragg that was not moving forward.\"\n38: Funding for the other three projects remains uncertain, but Tillis has given assurances that Congress can replenish the money.\n39: In an op-ed in the Greensboro News & Record, Tillis wrote that Congress \"has plenty of time to re-allocate funding\" and called on other members of Congress to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act.",

        "passage": "0: A recent Facebook post with a hashtag indicating support for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential bid argued this point in favor of the candidate\u2019s signature healthcare plan, Medicare for All : \"Just so we\u2019re clear: people with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not healthcare.\"\n1: This post, which has been shared more than 58,000 times since it was published on Aug. 4, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n2: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n3: First, let\u2019s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can access guns.\n4: Federal law prohibits the purchase and possession of firearms by people with felony convictions, domestic abusers, and people with specific kinds of mental health histories.\n5: The Gun Control Act prohibits transferring a gun to a person who \"has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution,\" according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics .\n6: Such people are also prohibited from possessing a gun.\n7: The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence \u2014 which advocates for a more comprehensive system for reporting mental illness and conducting background checks \u2014 states on its website that while such checks have blocked more than 3 million people in those categories from getting firearms, federal gun law generally doesn\u2019t affect other people who public health researchers have identified as having a higher risk of being dangerous, including other people who have suffered from severe mental illness.\n8: \"The system intended to limit access to firearms for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis still includes dangerous loopholes,\" the center says.\n9: The law center also points to a 2012 Mother Jones story .\n10: It reported that among 62 people accused in mass shootings in recent years, 38 \"displayed signs of possible mental health problems prior to the killings.\"\n11: Nearly 80 percent of the perpetrators obtained their weapons legally, according to the publication.\n12: In 2016, the New York Times detailed how people with mental illness are able to get guns.\n13: They can buy them from private sellers because federal law doesn\u2019t require background checks for such transactions.\n14: Or, they fall under a broader category of mental illness and skirt the restrictions federal law has for people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or deemed a \"mental defective\" by a court or other authority.\n15: Plus, mental health records are \"overwhelmingly under-reported to federal and state databases scanned during a background check,\" the story says.\n16: So while federal law prohibits people with certain kinds of mental health histories from owning a gun, there are gaps that leave room for people with severe mental illness to buy guns.\n17: Next, let\u2019s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can\u2019t access health care.\n18: The Affordable Care Act requires health plans in individual and small group markets to cover 10 essential benefits.\n19: Among them: mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment like counseling and psychotherapy.\n20: \"Pre-existing mental and behavioral health conditions are covered, and spending limits aren\u2019t allowed,\" reads a page on healthcare.gov covering mental health and substance abuse coverage.\n21: \"Marketplace plans can\u2019t deny you coverage or charge you more just because you have any pre-existing condition, including mental health and substance use disorder conditions.\"\n22: Other health plans characterized as \"short-term, limited duration insurance\" \u2014 often purchased to fill in coverage gaps such as when a person is between jobs \u2014 are not required to include Obamacare\u2019s essential benefits and can exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage or reject people entirely.\n23: The Obama administration limited these policies to just three months and regulated them so they couldn\u2019t be renewed, NPR reported in October , but the Trump Administration has changed that; in some states, people can buy such policies that last a year and can renew them twice.\n24: The National Alliance on Mental Illness has decried these short-term plans, saying they discriminate against mental illness .\n25: But they\u2019re not sold on the health insurance marketplace and people can\u2019t use federal subsidies to help pay for them.\n26: For very healthy people, these plans can be cheaper than what\u2019s available on healthcare.gov, said Linda Blumberg an institute fellow at Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, but it\u2019s a small segment of the overall insured population.\n27: Job-based coverage from large employers \u2014 meaning those with more than 50 employees -\u2014 could also limit mental health coverage, Blumberg said.\n28: But since the passage of federal mental health parity laws and the Affordable Care Act, plans that offer mental health benefits must do so in a way comparable to the other medical services they cover.\n29: Today, there are still problems with accessing mental health care, Blumberg said.\n30: Some areas have a shortage of providers, for example, or providers who aren\u2019t covered by certain insurance plans.\n31: Plus, if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sustains a lower court\u2019s decision to overturn the Affordable Care Act, she said, this Facebook post could be more meaningful.\n32: But with the exception of short-term plans, Blumberg said the claim that people with pre-existing mental health conditions don\u2019t have access to health care isn\u2019t correct.",

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., quickly weighed in on Twitter .\n3: \"Murray Energy, the largest coal company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy,\" Manchin tweeted on Oct. 29, 2019.\n4: \"If Murray rejects the UMWA pension plan obligations in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the UMWA pension fund will be insolvent by 2020.\n5: Before last night it was projected to be insolvent by 2022.\"\n6: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com However, we noticed a problem with how Manchin described Murray Energy.\n7: Is it really the largest coal company in the United States?\n8: Manchin\u2019s office pointed us to a New York Times article published about the bankruptcy the same day as his tweet.\n9: The article includes this sentence: \"Murray, the nation\u2019s largest privately held coal company, has nearly 7,000 employees and operates 17 mines in six states across Appalachia and the South as well as two mines in Colombia.\"\n10: Manchin\u2019s office also cited a CNN article from the same day that used similar language.\n11: \"The slow death of the American coal industry has forced Murray Energy, the largest private coal miner in the United States, to file for bankruptcy protection Tuesday,\" CNN\u2019s article said.\n12: Manchin\u2019s tweet glossed over a phrase repeated in both articles -- \"privately held.\"\n13: So where does Murray rank among all coal companies?\n14: Murray Energy pointed us to data from the Energy Information Administration, a division of the federal Department of Energy.\n15: Here\u2019s a table drawn from the agency\u2019s statistics.\n16: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This shows that Murray Energy ranks fourth, behind Peabody Energy Corp. , Arch Coal Inc. , and Cloud Peak Energy .\n17: We confirmed that each of the three companies ahead of Murray are publicly held, making Murray the largest private coal company but not the largest coal company overall.",

        "passage": "0: President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced in an email to Vermont media this week that it will be deploying resources to Vermont to help elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2020.\n1: In the email, the campaign took credit for the economic improvement the state has seen under Trump\u2019s presidency.\n2: It said that since he took office in 2017, Trump has added thousands of jobs across the state and given Vermonters an average tax cut of about $1,500.\n3: It also claimed that under Trump, fewer Vermonters have had to rely on food stamps.\n4: \"President Trump has lifted the prospect of voters across Vermont, overseeing a 11,742 decline of Vermont residents on food stamps,\" the campaign wrote.\n5: We know that Trump is in favor of restricting food stamp eligibility, and has even proposed a rule change that would cut benefits worth $7.5 million to about 5,200 households in Vermont.\n6: But has his presidency really led to reduced demand for the benefits?\n7: Trump\u2019s campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment, is correct that since the president took office, Vermont has seen about 12,000 fewer people using food stamps.\n8: When he entered the White House in January 2017, Vermont had 78,878 residents receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n9: In August 2019, the last month for which public data was available, that number was 67,195 \u2014 representing a drop of 11,683.\n10: But data also show that the demand for food stamps in Vermont has been falling consistently since around 2013, when Vermont\u2019s economy started turning a corner after the Great Recession.\n11: At peak demand in 2013, about 100,000 Vermonters were using food stamps.\n12: By January 2017, when Trump took office, that number had already fallen to about 79,000.\n13: Sean Brown, deputy commissioner of Vermont\u2019s Economic Services Division, said that since 2013, when the economy took a turn for the better and jobs started returning to the state, food stamps in Vermont have seen steady decline in use.\n14: \"That\u2019s just been a trend that we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last six years as the economy has improved and stayed strong,\" Brown said.\n15: Since 2014, the steady decline in demand for SNAP benefits has been a national trend, according to Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Income and Benefits Policy Center.\n16: She said that Trump deserves some credit for the drop in Vermont and around the U.S., because the economy during his time in office has remained strong.\n17: But she said it can\u2019t all be pinned on his presidency.\n18: \"It\u2019s been a continuation of a trend that\u2019s already begun,\" Wexler said.\n19: \"Certainly the continued improvement of the economy contributes to that because more people are working and more people may have income available that would put them above that cutoff but it wouldn\u2019t solely be related to one administration or the other.\"\n20: Erin O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston who specializes in\u00a0 U.S. social welfare policy, said that it may not just be the economy that\u2019s leading fewer Vermonters to use food stamps.\n21: Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to SNAP may also be discouraging more people from using the program, she said.\n22: And she added that undocumented immigrants may be avoiding signing up for food stamps , fearing Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.\n23: \"It\u2019s not necessarily that people are being lifted out of poverty,\" she said.\n24: \"It\u2019s that they\u2019re increasingly afraid to use a government program, or they think it might be cut.\"\n25: She said that \"correlation isn\u2019t causation,\" and that just because the demand for food stamps has fallen under Trump doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s responsible for the trend.\n26: \"Sitting presidents like to take credit for trends that predate them when they\u2019re positive, but when it\u2019s bad news sitting presidents are very good at blaming the last guy in office,\" she said.",

Elizabeth Warren, one of the top contenders and another advocate for Medicare for All , was not on the debate stage that night.\n38: (She went the night before .)\n39: Her detailed financial plan for Medicare for All includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which would increase federal revenue for Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes.\n40: When PolitiFact told Gruters what we found \u2014 mainly that the debate question did not include the condition that it would be free coverage \u2014 he replied: \"Illegal Immigrants have little more than what they are carrying with them when they cross the border, so as a result the only logical conclusion is that it would be free.\"",

Pritzker brought up the downward trend while highlighting the work his administration is doing to make higher education more affordable.\n8: \"People talk about the exodus from Illinois and they\u2019ve blamed it on a lot of things, because we\u2019ve lost population,\" Pritzker said .\n9: \"Illinois lost population in 94 out of the last 95 years, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a new thing that we have a slight out-trickle of people leaving the state.\n10: Nevertheless, I\u2019d like to reverse it.\n11: And so, the best way to do that is actually to keep our students here and attract students to our universities.\"\n12: Has Illinois, which is still the nation\u2019s sixth-largest state, lost population almost every year for most of the past century?\n13: And what, exactly, does Pritzker mean by \"lost population?\"\n14: Mixed messages The first and most specific part of Pritzker\u2019s claim is contradicted by annual population estimates maintained by the federal government.\n15: Illinois\u2019 overall population has grown \u2014 not declined \u2014 in all but 15 of the past 95 years for which the U.S. Census Bureau has data.\n16: In 1924, Illinois\u2019 population was 7.2 million, while in 2018, 12.7 million resided in the state.\n17: Figures for 2019 have not yet been released .\n18: So if population has gone up for most of the past century, what was Pritzker talking about?\n19: We asked his spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh, who told us the governor wasn\u2019t referring to total population but \"net domestic migration,\" which is a subset of overall population that measures the difference between the number of people who move into Illinois from another state versus those who move out of Illinois to other states.\n20: If more people leave Illinois than arrive from other states, it\u2019s considered net domestic out-migration, a definition that jibes with the second half of Pritzker\u2019s comment about a \"slight out-trickle\" of Illinois residents.\n21: And a 2016 report authored by some of the state\u2019s most prominent tax policy experts suggest he\u2019s correct that net domestic out-migration isn\u2019t a new phenomenon.\n22: Aside from a small increase in 1947, the last time more people moved from other states into Illinois than out of it was 1920, according to the report, which drew on estimates compiled from multiple federal sources by migration expert Lyman Stone.\n23: \"Illinois has reliably had negative net domestic migration for a century,\" Stone told us in an email.\n24: That also tracks with an analysis of census population estimates conducted by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey in response to our inquiry.\n25: He found Illinois has experienced net domestic out-migration annually since 2000, the earliest year for which he had comparable data.\n26: While domestic out-migration has driven Illinois\u2019 recent decline, however, Frey cautioned it\u2019s still just one piece of the puzzle when looking at changes in population over time.\n27: It\u2019s a metric that does not account for international migration, which Illinois and other large states such as New York and California have relied on for population gains.\n28: Nor does it include increases from the number of births that occur in a state.",

FACEBOOK!\"\n12: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n13: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n14: This isn\u2019t true.\n15: Facebook is a donation platform, and one that people appear to be using a lot.\n16: The company in September 2019 announced that since 2015, 45 million people have raised over $2 billion on the platform, with over $1 billion of that total coming from birthday fundraisers.\n17: What Facebook is not is a \"charity donations broker\" (in fact, charity experts told us they\u2019ve never heard that term before).\n18: The organization told us it does not declare users\u2019 donations as tax write-offs, nor does it deliver only 15% of a person\u2019s intended donation to the charity specified.\n19: Facebook members can access more than 750,000 nonprofit organizations using the social media donations platform.\n20: Facebook says it vets organizations by checking their 501(c)(3) status, IRS registration and tax ID numbers.\n21: Each nonprofit\u2019s Facebook page also includes a link to its detailed profile on GuideStar , an organization that tracks nonprofits using a database designed to help paint a picture of a nonprofit\u2019s activities and health.\n22: Facebook spokesperson Roya Winner told PolitiFact in an email that the post\u2019s claims are \"completely false.\"\n23: \"Facebook never claims any user\u2019s donations as our own, nor are we a \u2018charity donations broker.\u2019 We are a donation platform and payments to charities are processed by our licensed, regulated subsidiaries,\" Winner said.\n24: \"A donation to a nonprofit through its Facebook Page or a fundraiser on Facebook may be tax-deductible for the person who made the donation.\"\n25: The Facebook help center has a page explaining whether a particular donation is tax-deductible.\n26: It explains that since tax laws vary by country and region, users should consult a tax professional and review laws in their area to determine whether their donation is tax-deductible.\n27: The website also says that after a donation is made through the platform, a confirmation is sent to the email listed on that person\u2019s Facebook account.\n28: The confirmation shows the person made the donation as a charitable contribution, includes the nonprofit\u2019s EIN number, and states that the donor is not receiving any goods or services in return.\n29: But what about the claim that Facebook, by law, only needs to deliver \"15% of your donation to the charity organization you have chosen?\"\n30: That\u2019s also bogus.\n31: \"100% of what\u2019s raised using donate buttons and fundraisers created on Facebook goes to the benefiting nonprofit,\" Winner wrote in an email.\n32: \"Nonprofits either receive funds directly from Facebook, or via Network for Good, a Donor Advised Fund we partner with.\"\n33: These are the two main ways nonprofits can raise funds on Facebook.\n34: When a nonprofit enrolls in Facebook Payments, it has to raise at least $100 (per nonprofit, not per fundraiser) before it receives a payout directly to its bank account.\n35: Funds will roll over until the payout amount reaches the $100 minimum, and the payment process takes about two weeks, Facebook says .\n36: The organization should receive the donation about a month after it is made.\n37: For nonprofits not registered with Facebook Payments, donations can be dispersed through fundraising platforms Network for Good (used for the U.S, Canada and Australia) or PayPal Giving

nonprofits that are onboarded through Facebook Payments, or through Network for Good or Paypal Giving Fund, are able to fundraise on Facebook.\n41: Though some may worry that such contributions made to charities using the for-profit Facebook platform may not be tax-deductible, Winner told us that concern is unfounded.\n42: \"That\u2019s an inaccurate representation, the donation goes to the organization, not Facebook,\" she said.\n43: \"It is stated as a charitable contribution to the specific nonprofit on the confirmation receipt, along with the organization\u2019s EIN number.\"\n44: Facebook covers all fees for donations made on its website to charitable organizations.\n45: In November 2017 , the company announced it would drop the 5% transaction fee on donations to nonprofits on its platform.\n46: Facebook once had a 4.3% platform fee for personal fundraisers \u2013\u2013 which allows people to host their own fundraiser for a personal cause \u2013\u2013 but it eliminated that in May 2018 .\n47: Personal fundraisers are now subject to a 2.6% payment processing fee plus $0.30.\n48: In some countries, additional taxes will be deducted when the money raised is distributed.\n49: The fees broken down by country can be found here.",

        "passage": "0: Changes in New York\u2019s bail laws have been hailed by some nonprofit criminal justice organizations as a way to reduce inequities and mass incarceration.\n1: The changes will allow people who have been charged with certain crimes to stay out of jail while waiting for their trials without having to come up with money to post bail.\n2: But some in law enforcement are critical of the changes, which eliminate money bail for offenses that account for approximately 90 percent of arrests statewide.\n3: The union that represents active and retired police officers in New York City made a claim about the new law, which takes effect Jan. 1.\n4: In a Twitter post , the New York City Police Benevolent Association said, \"Defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free.\"\n5: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As evidence for its claim, the police union included in its tweet a section of state law regarding child pornography.\n6: The union cited section 263.10 of the penal code, which states : \"A person is\u00a0 guilty of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child when, knowing the character and\u00a0 content thereof, he produces, directs or promotes any obscene performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than seventeen years of age.\n7: Promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child is a class D felony.\"\n8: We\u2019ve heard many claims about what the new law will do, and we wondered if the police union\u2019s claim is accurate.\n9: The law\u2019s details The new law has a list of \"qualifying\" offenses for which a judge can set bail.\n10: These qualifying offenses are serious crimes, and some involve child pornography.\n11: Judges are permitted to impose bail under the new law for these offenses: facilitating a sexual performance by a child with a controlled substance or alcohol, use of a child in a sexual performance, or luring a child for the purpose of committing a crime against him or her.\n12: On April 1, 2019, when the new law was passed, three people with these qualifying offenses were in jail awaiting trial in New York City, according to a report from the Center for Court Innovation, which advocates for alternatives to incarceration.\n13: But not every child pornography charge described in the statute is a qualifying offense.\n14: A person charged with the offense cited by the union -- \"producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child\" -- would have to be released and bail would not be imposed.\n15: New York\u2019s pretrial law - the current one and the one that takes effect Jan. 1 - does not allow judges to evaluate whether a person is dangerous to the community when deciding whether that person should be held before trial.\n16: Unlike in other states, judges can only consider whether a\u00a0 defendant is likely to return to court .\n17: In cases where a judge\u00a0has doubts about whether the defendant is likely to return, the judge would have to\u00a0\"release the principal\" and select a non-monetary option, such as pretrial supervision\u00a0or travel restrictions, and choose the least restrictive option \"that will reasonably assure the principal\u2019s return to court,\" according to the law.\n18: What experts say We spoke with legal experts, some who specialize in prosecution and others in criminal defense.\n19: Many agreed with the police union's tweet.\n20: But several pointed to what they call a more realistic legal scenario.\n21: Taryn Merkl, a former federal prosecutor who led a human trafficking task force in Brooklyn, said that it is hard for her to imagine a set of facts in which a prosecutor would charge only this crime and not something more serious that would require bail.\n22: \"This doesn\u2019t strike me as the main charge one would bring,\" said Merkl, who is senior counsel in the Justice Program & Law Enforcement Leaders at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School.\n23: The Brennan Center is in favor of ending mass incarceration .\n24: We looked at arrest records from New York City since 2006 to get a sense of how often police charge this specific crime.\n25: We found that in at least 135 arrests, approximately 10 per year, this charge was the top charge.\n26: Merkl noted that that the charges that prosecutors decide to bring in a complaint or indictment can be different from those charges that a police file during an arrest.\n27: In addition, charges other than the \"top charge\" for these defendants could require detention, even if the top charge does not, according to the Center for Court Innovation.\n28: Rebecca Town, a criminal defense attorney at the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, which assists low-income people, said the charge cited by the police union is \"almost always\" accompanied by a sex offense under Article 130 of the state penal code, which allows a judge to set cash bail.\n29: \"If the individual accused is directly responsible for creating such material, they will be charged with something that is directly a sex offense that would still trigger money bail,\" Town said.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: During an Oct. 31 press conference, leaders from conservative advocacy organizations in Texas urged Gov.\n1: Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to elect a new House speaker.\n2: Earlier that month, embattled House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat in the House.\n3: The activists also outlined policy proposals that they want lawmakers to address during a special session, proposals they say Republican leaders failed to pursue during the regular session earlier this year.\n4: Cindi Castilla, president of the Dallas Eagle Forum, said lawmakers need to take steps to limit what gender transition treatments are available to children, in light of an ongoing legal battle in Dallas over the gender identity of a 7-year-old.\n5: \"During our last session, our legislators decided to pass a law protecting Texans from e-cigarettes until they reach the age of 21,\" she said.\n6: \"They left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life.\n7: This was a failing, and we need a remedy.\n8: \"Texas Eagle Forum asked lawmakers to carry a very common-sense bill that would protect young Texans.\n9: That bill would have protected (the child), no matter what the verdict was going to be from the courts.\"\n10: Before we dive into this check, it should be noted that medical or surgical treatments used by doctors for transitioning must meet the same safety requirements of other medications or surgeries.\n11: To suggest that any child might be mutilated by doctors is inaccurate.\n12: \"Children in Texas are already robustly protected by the Texas Family Code and medical rules of ethics,\" said Brian Klosterboer, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, in a statement.\n13: \"No one in Texas may harm a child, including parents and medical professionals.\"\n14: When reached via email, Castilla said that she is unaware of any state laws that \"protect children from being given treatments that can lead to sterilization and no law prohibiting surgeries that would seek to make a child appear to be a gender different than the gender they were born.\"\n15: \"Thus far, it appears very young children have been protected from this only because of the good sense of the medical community,\" she said.\n16: \"As we see this protection waning among a small portion of the medical community we would like to make sure that the most vulnerable Texans are protected.\"\n17: Castilla said the bill she mentioned at the press conference would have \"protected children from these procedures,\" but the group could not find a lawmaker to carry the legislation.\n18: Dallas custody case The legal battle in Dallas that Castilla mentioned in her remarks is a custody dispute between a mother and father that centers on the gender identity of their 7-year-old child.\n19: The child\u2019s mother says the 7-year-old is a transgender girl and wants to dress as a girl and be identified by female pronouns \u2014 a process referred to as a social transition .\n20: The child\u2019s father disagrees and insists that the child is a boy.\n21: The case has spurred a national debate about children and their gender identities, with some Texas Republicans pledging to pursue legislation to prevent minors in Texas from transitioning by medical means.\n22: Gillian Branstetter, spokeswoman for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said an important point to consider in this case is the child\u2019s age.\n23: \"This child is 7 years old,\" she said, noting that \"no one is talking about\" pursuing a medical or surgical transition.\n24: \"We\u2019re talking about gender affirming parenting and letting the child explore who they are.\"\n25: Looking at the law Under federal law, transition-related medical care is considered the same as any other medically-necessary care and carries the same requirements when it comes to minors, according to Branstetter and attorneys with ACLU of Texas.\n26: Generally speaking , Texas law dictates that parents have a \"duty\" to provide medical and dental care to their children and they have the \"right\" to consent to that care.\n27: But pursuing gender transition treatment is an individualized process for transgender and gender non-binary people and can take many forms, according to multiple resources on gender identity and gender dysphoria.\n28: People with gender dysphoria \u2014 when a person feels a conflict between the gender they were assigned at birth and the gender with which they identify \u2014 choose to act on this in different ways.\n29: This can include wearing clothes and using pronouns associated with their gender identity; changing their gender and name on legal documents; pursuing hormone treatment or surgical options available for transitioning.\n30: Not every person who has gender dysphoria and is transgender will pursue medical or surgical transition treatment.\n31: People can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria at any age, even as children.\n32: \"While some children express feelings and behaviors relating to gender dysphoria at 4 years old or younger, many may not express feelings and behaviors until puberty or much later,\" reads an article on the subject from the American Psychiatric Association.\n33: \"For some children, when they experience puberty, they suddenly find themselves unable to identify with their own body.\n34: Medical treatment standards prioritize affirmation When it comes to caring for children who might be exhibiting signs of gender dysphoria, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the \"gender-affirmative care model\" that prioritizes validating a child\u2019s gender identity and supporting their exploration and expression of that identity.\n35: \"There are absolutely no medical interventions or surgical interventions on any prepubertal child,\" said Colt Keo-Meier, a Texas-based psychologist and author who specializes in gender and sexual health.\n36: \"That is not happening.\"\n37: The widely accepted \"Standards of Care\" maintained by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health also emphasize this point.\n38: \"Before any physical interventions are considered for adolescents, extensive exploration of psychological, family, and social issues should be undertaken,\" the standards read.\n39: \"The duration of this exploration may vary considerably depending on the complexity of the situation.\"\n40: Once a child starts puberty, other options emerge.\n41: Keo-Meier said the most common treatment \u2014 medication to delay the onset of puberty \u2014 is fully reversible.\n42: \"That is literally just hitting pause,\" he said.\n43: The World Professional Association for Transgender Health outline minimum criteria that must be met before a child can receive puberty-suppressing medication, including that the child has demonstrated a \"long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria\" and that it \"emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty.\"\n44: Other, interventions like hormone therapy (partially reversible) or surgery (irreversible) won\u2019t be considered until a patient reaches adolescence.\n45: Even then, the Standards of Care stress that certain procedures should not be performed until a patient is old enough to consent on their own (typically 16-18 years old) and others should occur only once a person has received other treatments for a specific time period.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: A viral Facebook post that has peppered social media for at least a year was given fresh life last month when former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shared it on her account.\n1: \"449,000 Californians turned down jury duty because they were not citizens\u2026 but they WERE registered voters,\" reads the text of the Oct. 2 post.\n2: \"Let that sink in.\"\n3: This post, which has been shared more than 57,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n4: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n5: After searching online and in the Nexis news archive, we couldn\u2019t find this statistic in any news coverage.\n6: So we started reaching out to California officials.\n7: Sam Mahood, a spokesperson for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, told us he couldn\u2019t comment on how many Californians declined jury duty on citizenship grounds \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s not the office\u2019s purview \u2014\u00a0but he said it\u2019s not true that 449,000 noncitizens were registered to vote.\n8: Here\u2019s what else you should know about potential jurors in California.\n9: First, people who are summoned for jury duty don\u2019t \"turn it down,\" said Blaine Corren, a public affairs analyst for the Judicial Council of California .\n10: Rather, they can be excused from jury duty for various reasons, or a court can disqualify them from serving based on a number of factors including not being 18 or older, having a felony conviction on their record or for not being a citizen of the United States.\n11: The council collects statewide data on how many people were excused or disqualified and why \u2014 with some caveats.\n12: That information comes to the council from individual trial courts but since there\u2019s no requirement that courts provide this data, some courts and categories may be missing in the Jury Data Reports the council produces.\n13: The data the state keeps on why someone was excused from jury duty includes financial hardship and physical or mental disabilities, but not citizenship status.\n14: The Judicial Council of California does, however, keep track of how many people were disqualified for jury duty because they\u2019re not citizens.\n15: We requested the council\u2019s reports through the most recent fiscal year for which a completed report is available, which was July 2017-June 2018.\n16: Our analysis shows that, annually, around 1 million people \u2014 citizens and noncitizens \u2014\u00a0are disqualified from jury duty in California.\n17: Approximately half aren\u2019t citizens.\n18: From July 2008 through June 2017, about 11.3 million people were disqualified.\n19: Of those, about 4.7 million were disqualified for not being a U.S. citizen.\n20: In 2017-2018, 1,063,784 people overall were disqualified with 425,814 for not being citizens.\n21: But it was fiscal year 2016-17 that has a figure that comes closest to the claim in the Facebook post: Among 1,096,478 people who were disqualified for jury duty that year, 449,404 were disqualified for not being U.S. citizens.\n22: But that doesn\u2019t mean that those rejected juror candidates were registered to vote.\n23: One of the primary sources courts use to summon jurors is the voter registration list, Corren said.\n24: The other is the state Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 list of licensed drivers and identification card holders in the area served by the court.\n25: Noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents, can get driver\u2019s licenses.\n26: As of 2015 , undocumented immigrants in California can, too.\n27: So it follows that noncitizens \u2014 both lawful permanent residents and undocumented immigrants \u2014\u00a0would be summoned for jury duty as courts tap potential jurors from DMV data.\n28: \"These two lists are considered inclusive of a representative cross-section of the population, according to the California Code of Civil Procedure,\" Corren said.\n29: But, he added, courts could seek jurors from other sources like telephone directories and utility company lists.\n30: In Nevada County, Calif., for example, 97 potential jurors were excused because they weren\u2019t citizens, said Jason Galkin, court executive officer of the Superior Court there.\n31: Galkin said the county tapped them from a list it got from the DMV.\n32: But searching for their names on the voter registration list, he said, there were no matches.\n33: In fiscal year 2017-2018, three Sierra County residents were dismissed from jury duty because they weren\u2019t citizens but none of them were registered voters, said Jean-Anne Cheatham, a court assistant there.\n34: Karen Dalton, a spokesperson for the San Diego County Superior Court, told us most courts in California use the DMV\u2019s driver\u2019s license database as its primary source for the jury master list and then augment that with the voter registrar's list.\n35: In California, noncitizens can get driver\u2019s licenses so, again, it follows that noncitizens would appear for jury duty in San Diego County, among others.\n36: The DMV has a \"motor voter\" program that automatically registers eligible driver\u2019s license applicants unless they opt out.\n37: Sometimes, Corren said, people will inadvertently mark themselves down to register to vote and it\u2019s possible that the lists courts receive from the DMV include these individuals.\n38: That information also goes to the California Secretary of State\u2019s office to determine whether to add them to the voter rolls, according to Corren.\n39: The office then reviews the lists and cancels requests to register to vote from people who aren\u2019t eligible, he said.\n40: Three Republican voters recently sued Secretary of State Padilla over the \"motor voter\" program, claiming that the state enables voter fraud by failing to investigate voters\u2019 citizenship status, Courthouse News Service reported on Oct. 1.\n41: Since the DMV started automatically registering people to vote in April 2018, it acknowledged making 105,000 processing errors out of more than 2.4 million, according to a January Sacramento Bee story , and at least one noncitizen came forward to say he was improperly added to the voter rolls.\n42: But that doesn\u2019t mean that 105,000 noncitizens cast ballots.\n43: Sam Mahood, with the secretary of state\u2019s office, told us he doesn\u2019t know of any recent convictions for noncitizens registering to vote.\n44: It\u2019s also a far cry from the Facebook post\u2019s claim: that 449,000 noncitizens were registered voters who had also been summoned for jury duty and turned it down.",

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: Promoting her much-discussed plan to create a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" health system, Sen. Elizabeth Warren emphasized a striking figure.\n1: \"If we make no changes over the next 10 years, Americans will reach into their pockets and pay out about $11 trillion on insurance premiums, copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an Instagram video posted Nov. 4.\n2: The Democratic health care debate has been full of competing analyses and estimates about what Medicare for All might cost, what it might save and who would bear the brunt of paying for it.\n3: But this precise number was new to us.\n4: If true, it would be a figure both staggering and significant to the unfolding debate, as Americans try to understand how Warren\u2019s brand of a single-payer health system could affect their pocketbooks.\n5: So we decided to dig in.\n6: A reasonable estimate We contacted the Warren campaign, which redirected us to a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, as well as to federal estimates of household out-of-pocket expenses and premium costs over the next decade.\n7: The Urban report doesn\u2019t include the $11 trillion figure.\n8: But economist Linda Blumberg, who authored the paper , told us the statistic is \"perfectly consistent\" with the analysis.\n9: If anything, she said, the number is a lowball figure.\n10: When Blumberg and her team crunched the numbers, they found that, under the existing health care system, Americans can expect to pay $11.7 trillion between out-of-pocket costs \u2013 the copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses \u2013 and premiums over the next decade.\n11: That calculation comes from Urban\u2019s model for projecting what individual households might expect to spend, factoring in inflation, on these types of health costs.\n12: \"Talking about the amount of money we expect households to be spending over time is a very important part of trying to educate people on what single-payer would do, and what the tradeoffs are for them,\" said Blumberg, who previously advised the Clinton White House on health policy.\n13: On the numbers, \"they\u2019re roughly in the right neighborhood,\" she added.\n14: We consulted other analysts, too, and as far as we can tell, no one else has done a similar calculation.\n15: Experts told us that Urban\u2019s estimate \u2014 and the Warren campaign\u2019s use of it \u2014 checks out, based on what we know about American health care spending.\n16: Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation and expert on the Affordable Care Act, pointed to what a typical American family currently spends on health care: about $5,000 per year, when you look at out-of-pocket costs and premiums combined.\n17: Extrapolating from there, she said, Warren\u2019s claim seems reasonable.\n18: (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n19: \"Over the course of 10 years, when you add it up \u2014 that sounds about right,\" Cox said.\n20: \"The reality is, people do spend a lot on health care out of their pockets, and there\u2019s a lot spent on their behalf by employers or taxpayer-funded programs that they never see.\"\n21: Under Warren\u2019s health care plan, Americans would pay nothing directly out-of-pocket \u2014 no premiums, copays or deductibles \u2014 for health care.\n22: So that $11 trillion would disappear from the cost side of the ledger.\n23: The figure Warren sited also tracks with national health expenditure projections for out-of-pocket health costs and health premium growth.\n24: The bigger picture Still, there are serious questions about the financing such a shift would require.\n25: And Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plan has been under intense scrutiny since she unveiled it earlier this month, with many critics suggesting it\u2019s too optimistic in its estimates of how much money a single-payer system would cost.\n26: Warren suggests the federal government would need to come up with $20.5 trillion \u2014 well below Urban\u2019s estimate of $34 trillion.\n27: The difference comes largely from assumptions about how much the government could save, as well as decisions about how much to pay doctors and hospitals.\n28: Warren\u2019s financing structure includes cracking down on tax evasion, new taxes on financial institutions and the wealthiest Americans, and maintaining what many employers currently pay into the system.\n29: Critics say that could yield its own inefficiencies.\n30: For instance, the way employer payments are structured could disproportionately harm small businesses, or lower-wage workers, noted Paul Ginsburg, who directs the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.\n31: He also argued that doctors and hospitals \u2014represented by powerful lobbying organizations in Washington \u2014 could successfully battle any effort to pay them less, driving up what the government needs to spend.\n32: Still, those disputes are separate from the question of this particular statistic.\n33: Here, Warren\u2019s on firm ground.\n34: Analysts also said the $11 trillion number gets at a larger point.\n35: Americans currently pay a lot out-of-pocket on health care.\n36: Certainly, some might see a tax hike under Warren\u2019s proposed reform, or see downward pressure on their salaries.\n37: Still, others could experience major pocketbook relief.\n38: To be sure, Medicare for All is not the only approach to ameliorating what families pay for health care.\n39: Other, more incremental proposals \u2014 such as building on the ACA\u2019s coverage expansions or pursuing a \"Medicare for all who want it\" approach touted by former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor \u2014 would cut into the $11 trillion as well, Cox said.\n40: While it wouldn\u2019t eliminate that household cost burden, it would require less in taxes to finance.\n41: \"There\u2019s a lot of ways to bring down what people spend on health care,\" Cox said.\n42: \"Any expansion of the role of public programs is likely to bring down individuals\u2019 costs.\n43: It\u2019s just a question of how much taxes have to go up to pay for that.\"",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has led the House investigation into a July phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n6: A key question is whether Trump held up military and State Department aid in exchange for the Biden probe.\n7: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Facebook) Our research shows that the Facebook post about Schiff\u2019s role is flawed.\n8: We reached out to Trump Rules, a conservative Facebook page with nearly 150,000 followers, for the source of its post and did not hear back.\n9: Here\u2019s what you need to know from the House impeachment resolution : \u2022 Witness requests from ranking minority member Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., must go through Schiff first \u2014 but the decision to allow them is not Schiff\u2019s alone.\n10: \u2022 Trump gets counsel during Judiciary Committee hearings, but not during Intelligence Committee hearings.\n11: The Judiciary Committee leads official impeachment proceedings in the House, while the Intelligence Committee leads the investigation.\n12: \u2022 The Democrats\u2019 resolution does not require questions of witnesses to first be approved by Schiff.\n13: Calling witnesses The House resolution says requests from members to call witnesses to provide testimony must be submitted in writing to Schiff.\n14: They have three days to do that after a hearing is announced.\n15: But the Facebook post overreaches in saying that the rules \"do not allow any witness to be called\" without his approval.\n16: Here\u2019s what the resolution says about the power of members in the minority: \"To allow for full evaluation of minority witness requests, the ranking minority member may submit to the chair, in writing, any requests for witness testimony relevant to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution within 72 hours after notice is given for the first hearing designated pursuant to paragraph (1).\n17: Any such request shall be accompanied by a detailed written justification of the relevance of the testimony of each requested witness to the investigation described in the first section of this resolution.\"\n18: That means any request from Nunes for additional testimony must go through Schiff.\n19: RELATED: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place The impeachment resolution says that if Schiff were to refuse a request for additional witnesses, Republicans can bring the matter to a vote by the entire Intelligence Committee.\n20: There are 22 members of the committee, meaning the ultimate decision to call witnesses would not just come down to Schiff.\n21: However, in practice, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Democratic majority would vote with Schiff.\n22: Democrats did not come up with these rules out of thin air.\n23: They borrowed from House investigation procedures that Republicans passed in 2015, said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and an impeachment expert, in an email.\n24: The president\u2019s legal counsel The claim that the impeachment resolution does not permit Trump a lawyer is only partially accurate \u2014 the two House committees leading the inquiry have different rules.\n25: The first is the Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n26: Under the House resolution, there is no role for the president\u2019s lawyers to cross-examine witnesses, submit new evidence or provide a formal defense during hearings called by that committee.\n27: However, the Judiciary Committee, which will assess the Intelligence Committee\u2019s findings, is permitted to carry out its work \"as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel,\" according to the resolution.\n28: And the Judiciary Committee has described a clear role for the president\u2019s counsel in those hearings.\n29: \"The rules do permit participation by (the president\u2019s) counsel, unless (the president) blocks production of evidence requested by (the) Committee,\" Bowman said.\n30: Witness questioning The House resolution does not say Schiff must approve all questions during impeachment proceedings.\n31: RELATED: There\u2019s no evidence Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint Here\u2019s what the rules say about questioning witnesses: \"The chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select Committee shall be permitted to question witnesses for equal specified periods of longer than five minutes, as determined by the chair.\n32: The time available for each period of questioning under this paragraph shall be equal for the chair and the ranking minority member.\"\n33: Per those rules, Schiff and Nunes will each have the opportunity to question witnesses.\n34: The resolution says nothing about Schiff approving Nunes\u2019 questions ahead of time.\n35: \"The questioning rule seems a complete invention,\" Bowman said.",

kept.\"\n4: The ad then pivots to Obama: \"Here is President Obama: 'Plantation politics.\n5: black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant.\n6: But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we\u2019d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.'\n7: \" The narrator then continues: \"Enough empty promises.\n8: President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered.\n9: Democrats don\u2019t care about us.\"\n10: The ad ran Nov. 8 largely in states with a significant African American population including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana.\n11: Trump is trying to chip away at the wide margin by which African Americans vote for Democrats.\n12: His ad coincided with his \"Black Voices for Trump\" visit in Atlanta.\n13: (Judd Legum, who writes the newsletter Popular Information, tweeted about the ad the day it first started running.)\n14: The ad takes words from a book by Obama where he was talking from the perspective of someone else.\n15: It takes those words out of context and gives them a meaning they didn\u2019t have.\n16: What Obama wrote in his book We\u2019ve heard a similar ad before from a pro-Trump group.\n17: During a congressional election in Georgia in 2017, Great America Alliance ran a radio ad aimed at cutting African American turnout for Democrat Jon Ossoff.\n18: We rated that ad Pants on Fire.\n19: The voice in that and the current ad sounds like Obama\u2019s, but the words were not his own views.\n20: They came from Obama reading from his 1995 book \" Dreams From My Father \" about his days as a community organizer in Chicago.\n21: He recounted his conversation with a barber he called Smitty about Chicago\u2019s first black mayor, Harold Washington.\n22: Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington.\n23: Here\u2019s how the scene plays in the book: \"Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,\" Smitty said.\n24: \"Before Harold, seemed like we\u2019d always be second-class citizens.\"\n25: \"Plantation politics,\" the man with the newspaper said.\n26: \"That\u2019s just what it was, too,\" Smitty said.\n27: \"A plantation.\n28: Black people in the worst jobs.\n29: The worst housing.\n30: Police brutality rampant.\n31: But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket.\n32: Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.\n33: White folks spitting in our faces, and we\u2019d reward \u2018em with the vote.\"\n34: In his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified.\n35: Obama wrote: \"They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old.\n36: And their faith had been rewarded.\"\n37: In Smitty\u2019s words, \"The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets,\u2026.\"\n38: he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves.\n39: \"When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life.\"\n40: The pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time.\n41: But the actual book passage is about the good things that come from voting.\n42: Chad Banghart, the executive director of the PAC, told us that he thinks it is clear that the ad is Obama reading from his book.\n43: However, the ad never states the context of Obama\u2019s words.\n44: Banghart also suggested that Smitty the barber was a fictional creation.\n45: In the introduction of the book, Obama wrote that for the sake of compression some of the characters are composites .\n46: He wrote that other than family or public figures, the names of most characters were changed to protect their privacy.\n47: The Chicago Tribune identified the location of the barber shop in 2008 and in this 2015 graphic .\n48: The ad also said that \"President Trump promised us jobs and he delivered.\"\n49: We found in August that the unemployment rates and poverty rates for African Americans are indeed at or near historical lows, as Trump indicated.\n50: However, there were also declines under Obama too.\n51: The text on the ad included attacks on four of the Democrats running for president: former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S.\n52: Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n53: These attacks related to Biden\u2019s record opposing school busing , Harris\u2019 record as a prosecutor , Warren\u2019s statements identifying herself as Native American , and Sanders\u2019 statements on reparations .",

Wong, an associate professor and director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at the University of California, San Diego.\n24: The government\u2019s arrest data should not be taken to imply guilt or a conviction, he said.\n25: If DACA recipients have become \"hardened criminals,\" Chen said, they would be ineligible for renewals at two-year intervals.",

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked each witness whether they were a Never Trumper.\n7: Both said they were not .\n8: We\u2019ve found no evidence that either Taylor or Kent qualify under any reasonable definition of \"Never Trumpers.\"\n9: (Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to inquiries for this article.)\n10: The careers of Kent and Taylor Nothing in Taylor\u2019s or Kent\u2019s biographies shows they have strong political views.\n11: They have been in government for decades, serving under presidents of both parties.\n12: Taylor is the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a role known as the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires.\n13: A career diplomat and U.S. Army veteran, he has worked in every administration since 1985, including most recently as the ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.\n14: Kent is a career foreign-service officer who currently oversees State Department policy towards Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n15: From 2015 to 2018, Kent served as deputy chief of mission in Kyiv.\n16: Previously, he served as the senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau.\n17: From 2012 to 2014, he directed the State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.\n18: His earlier foreign service postings have included Warsaw; Kyiv; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Bangkok.\n19: Notably, both Taylor and Kent continue to serve in the Trump administration, and Trump officials named them to their current posts.\n20: What is a Never Trumper?\n21: The term \"Never Trumper\" came to prominence during the 2016 election to refer to individuals, especially Republicans, who were unhappy that Trump was the GOP nominee.\n22: Liz Mair, one of the early leaders of the Never Trump movement, said she would define Never Trumper as \"a Republican who a) voted for Hillary Clinton b) voted third-party c) cast a write-in vote or d) refused to vote in 2016 and has not subsequently reversed course by expressing support for Trump, working for the Trump administration, donating to Trump, endorsing him in 2020, or contemplating voting for him in 2020.\"\n23: Often, the term has been used in reference to historically Republican or nonpartisan foreign policy officials and advisers who refused to join the Trump administration if he were to win the 2016 election.\n24: At times, such officials publicly signed their names to letters.\n25: One of them , circulated by foreign-policy expert Eliot A. Cohen and others, said that \"as committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head.\n26: We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office.\"\n27: That letter included 122 signatures, none of which belong to Taylor or Kent.\n28: A second letter, published in the New York Times , said, \"None of us will vote for Donald Trump.\n29: From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief.\n30: Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country\u2019s national security and well-being.\"\n31: None of the 50 signatories were Taylor or Kent.\n32: Tom Nichols, a U.S.\n33: Naval War College professor in national security affairs who has become a prominent Never Trump voice, told PolitiFact that he considers it \"laughable\" to call either Taylor or Kent a Never Trumper.\n34: \"I did not know of either of them until now, and I have been a regular at meetings of the Never Trump group in D.C. for over two years,\" Nichols said, speaking in his personal capacity.\n35: \"This makes no sense to me and seems to be an appellation applied to anyone Trump doesn't like after the fact.\"\n36: Mair agreed.\n37: \"Kent and Taylor have never been regarded by Never Trumpers as Never Trumpers,\" she said.\n38: She added that, before the Ukraine controversy erupted, she heard other Never Trumpers privately deriding Taylor, Kent, or both as \"enablers\" of Trump by agreeing to serve in his administration.\n39: Geoffrey Kabaservice, director of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a think tank, helped organize some Never Trumper events in Washington.\n40: \"Certainly I had never heard either mentioned as a Never Trumper,\" he told PolitiFact.\n41: \"Trump clearly is trying to define a Never Trumper as a Republican and/or conservative who criticizes any aspect of Trump's presidency, or who cooperates with critics of Trump.\"\n42: What about Taylor\u2019s lawyer?\n43: According to news reports , John B. Bellinger III, a lawyer with the firm Arnold & Porter, now represents Taylor.\n44: Bellinger does have tangible Never Trumper credentials.\n45: Bellinger signed the second letter referenced above, and he also joined a group of conservative legal figures opposed to Trump.\n46: \"Conservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president,\" Bellinger, a State Department and White House lawyer under President George W. Bush, told the New York Times in November 2018.\n47: However, just because Bellinger is a Never Trumper doesn\u2019t mean that Taylor himself is a Never Trumper.\n48: In any case, Trump made the distinction on Oct. 23 when he tweeted , \"Never Trumper Republican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don\u2019t know), in testimony before Congress!\"\n49: We reached out to Bellinger\u2019s firm for this article but did not hear back.",

Adam Schiff , D-Calif., as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, led the Nov. 13 hearing where Taylor testified.\n13: At one point, Schiff asked Taylor why it was important for the United States to help protect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\n14: Taylor replied that the United States has a national defense policy that identifies Russia and China as adversaries.\n15: \"The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years,\" Taylor said, \"If we don\u2019t push back on those violations then that will continue.\n16: That affects us.\n17: That affects the world we live in, that our children and grandchildren will grow up in.\"\n18: Major violations Here are two key Russian violations experts cited to us: 1.\n19: Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine The 1994 memorandum committed the United States, Russia and England to, among other things, \"respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine\" and to \"refrain from the threat or use of force\" against that country.\n20: By 2014, Russia had \"grossly violated the commitments it made in that document,\" wrote Steven Pifer , a senior fellow at the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.\n21: \"Basically, the agreement was that the three Soviet republics that had nukes based on their territory would send the weapons to Russia, in return for which Russia, the U.S. and others would guarantee their security,\" Harley Balzer , a Russia expert and emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told us.\n22: \"Annexing Crimea and supporting the separatists in Eastern Ukraine is a clear betrayal.\n23: \"That is a major concern,\" Balzer added.\n24: \"Why would North Korea or anyone else give up nukes if no one will hold the Russians accountable for this reversal?\"\n25: 2\n26: Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty The 1987 treaty, which banned the United States and Russia from fielding land-based missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, ended in August 2019.\n27: The U.S. government said Russia\u2019s government violated the treaty with, for example, the 9M729 missile, which developed in the mid 2000s and flew longer than the permissible distance, ForeignPolicy.com reported .\n28: \"All of the United States\u2019 NATO allies said they agreed with the U.S. judgment: Russia was breaking the rules.\"\n29: The rule-breaking started in about 2014 in direct violation of the treaty, Kroenig told us.\n30: The Obama administration accused Russia of cheating at that time, and the Trump administration withdrew from the treaty in 2018.\n31: More violations The Crimea annexation and Russia\u2019s armed aggression in 2019 in the Donbass region of Ukraine means \"they have certainly violated a lot of their commitments,\" Pifer told us.\n32: He said that includes the 1975 Helsinki Final Act\u2019s provisions on respecting sovereignty; and the provisions of the 1997 Ukraine-Russia Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership on territorial integrity and non-use of force against the other.\n33: In addition, he said, the UN Charter says that states shall refrain from use of force except in self-defense or if authorized by the UN Security Council.\n34: Russia had agreed to get rid of many of its tactical nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, under the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives agreement, Kroenig said.\n35: \"But it kept many more than it promised to and is now building more,\" he said.\n36: In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 suspended implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.\n37: Bergmann and Kroenig said that among the agreements in which Russia is in compliance is the New START Treaty , an arms-limitation deal signed by the United States and Russia in 2011.\n38: But Russia \"is building several new strategic systems that threaten the future viability of the treaty,\" Kroenig said.",

        "passage": "0: With the 2020 general election just under a year away, major political parties on both sides of the aisle are ramping up fundraising.\n1: For the Missouri GOP, this has included making some bold claims, such as the one made in an email by Chairwoman of the Missouri Republican Party Kay Hoflander.\n2: The October 11 email said, \"Have you seen the recent news about Hillary?\n3: All signs seem to point to Hillary laying the groundwork to run for president again...GOOD!\n4: We welcome her to lose again next November, especially here in Missouri.\"\n5: It\u2019s a tactic to strike fear in the hearts of the Grand Old Party\u2019s potential donors.\n6: On its face, a Clinton run seems unlikely.\n7: But we were curious.\n8: Are there any signs suggesting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is planning another run for president in 2020?\n9: We decided to investigate.\n10: Candidate filings We started by looking into the basics \u2014 Federal Election Commission statements of candidacy.\n11: According to FEC rules, any individual running for federal office must register as a candidate within 15 days of becoming a candidate, which occurs when he or she has raised or spent more than $5,000.\n12: Clinton filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2008 election about 21 months before the general election.\n13: She filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2016 election nearly 19 months before the general election.\n14: If Clinton were to file a statement of candidacy now \u2014 joining President Donald Trump and fellow Democrats, all of whom have already declared their candidacy to the FEC \u2014 she would be doing so only 12 months before the general election.\n15: If Clinton decided on a late-stage run, she would also not be on the primary ballot in Alabama.\n16: The deadline to qualify and be on the March 3, 2020, ballot in Alabama was last Friday.\n17: While former New York City mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg made headlines last week by filing paperwork to qualify, Clinton did not take the same step.\n18: What has Clinton said about running?\n19: At least twice, Clinton made flat out denials: \"I\u2019m not running,\" she told New York television in March.\n20: \"But I\u2019m going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.\"\n21: \"No, I\u2019m not going to run again,\" she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s \"Woman\u2019s Hour\" in October 2017.\n22: Jean Evans, the GOP executive director, in an email response specifically cited two articles she said indicate that Clinton\u2019s behavior is \"typical of someone who is seriously considering candidacy.\"\n23: The first article from the Washington Post said Clinton is being urged to run, but in the same sentence also said she \"signaled that she isn\u2019t planning to run \u2014 at least, not at the moment.\"\n24: Evans\u2019 second example was the rumors after Clinton teased at the idea of a 2020 run on Twitter.\n25: On Oct. 8, Trump tweeted that Clinton should enter the presidential race, and Clinton responded, \"Don\u2019t tempt me.\"\n26: Despite this, former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in January he believes Clinton when she says she isn\u2019t running.\n27: He told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that the idea of a 2020 Clinton run was \"media catnip.\"\n28: One of Clinton\u2019s former advisors, Philippe Reines, said in late October that Clinton had not ruled out a 2020 run entirely.\n29: Experts weigh-in Stuart Streichler, a University of Washington affiliate associate professor of law, societies, and justice, said there are a number of problems Clinton would face entering the race so late in the game.\n30: Streichler \u2014 who has provided volunteer legal counsel to Sen. Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign and worked as a Wisconsin poll observer during Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run \u2014 explained that it would be \"highly unusual\" for someone to enter the race at this point.\n31: \"A lot of the staff \u2014 the talent that you would want to get as staff \u2014 are already working for other candidates,\" Streichler said.\n32: Adjunct professor of law at American University Louis Caldera said leading candidates \"already have an extensive ground game in Iowa and in the early primary states with millions in the bank,\" which makes it even less likely that Clinton would try to jump in now.\n33: Streichler said money and donors are already committed to other candidates.\n34: Streichler and Caldera acknowledged that Clinton would have name recognition on her side if she decided to run.\n35: But Streichler said he thinks \"there\u2019s almost a zero percent chance\" someone new could successfully enter the Democratic field now unless there was a major shift.\n36: (Example: In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after almost losing the New Hampshire primary to Sen. Eugene McCarthy.\n37: Johnson\u2019s departure allowed candidates like Sen. Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 who entered the race just days after the embarrassing New Hampshire primary \u2014 to gain a foothold.)\n38: Caldera, who also has an extensive background in public service including serving as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Secretary of the Army and working in the Obama White House, added that someone entering the race late would need a \"breakout moment.\"\n39: But he thinks the odds of Clinton jumping into the race are low.\n40: \"One of the truisms of politics is that the closer you get to the Election Day, the fewer undecided votes there are to convince,\" Caldera said.\n41: Clinton\u2019s Democratic colleagues in the Senate have also warned her against another run for president, and her allies have said they are not taking the talk of her running again in 2020 seriously, according to Politico reporting.\n42: Why did the GOP make this claim?\n43: The Missouri GOP appears to be using this claim to spur fundraising; the email ends with the sentence, \"I am not asking for much, but I am asking for participation to make sure we don't see a President Biden, Warren, Sanders, or Clinton in our future!\"\n44: It is followed by Kay Hoflander\u2019s sign-off and a button that reads, \"Click to give $1 or a [sic] more now!\"\n45: Caldera said this is not a new tactic.\n46: \"In politics, party leaders like to fire up the base by trotting out the people who they think they\u2019ll get the strongest response to,\" Caldera said.\n47: He explained that even in local elections, unpopular members of the opposing party are often brought up.\n48: Because getting President Trump reelected is the primary job of Republican party leaders, Caldera said it made sense that they would single out Hillary Clinton, who stirs up strong negative reactions among GOP supporters, as a potential threat to Trump\u2019s in 2020.\n49: \"You know, it\u2019s throwing red meat,\" Caldera said.\n50: \"It\u2019s getting people to try to have an immediate negative response and leading them to click on the \u2018donate now\u2019 button.\"\n51: He added that as the incumbent president, Trump can run against the Democratic party as a whole or he can target individual opponents.\n52: But Caldera explained that Trump would want to avoid elevating any potential Democratic nominees at this stage.\n53: \"It\u2019s a lot easier to say, \u2018Hey, remember that person who almost beat him the last time and that we really don\u2019t like?\n54: She might jump in the race if we\u2019re not really formidable in our fundraising and scare her off,\" Caldera said.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller waded into hot salsa on Saturday, when he commented on a Facebook post about a local chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans that was told it could not participate in the Stephenville Veterans\u2019 Day parade unless the group removed Confederate flags from its display.\n1: The post, shared to an Erath County Facebook group, was shared more than 2,000 times and garnered dozens of comments \u2014 including one from the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner.\n2: \"Who told them to leave?\"\n3: Miller wrote.\n4: \"Get a rope.\"\n5: After people expressed outrage at his remark, Miller edited the comment and added: \"Good grief people, it\u2019s a joke, an old saying from a Pace Picante commercial.\n6: Lighten up.\"\n7: Miller also shared a post about the incident on his Facebook page after the Texas Tribune wrote an article about his comment: \"I guess the young leftists at the Texas Tribune have never heard or watched the Pace Salsa commercial.\n8: I would also bet that they are not aware that Confederate veterans were conferred with many of the same benefits of other United States military veterans by Acts of Congress back in 1929 and 1957.\n9: Sad, that on a day in which we should honor all of our veterans, including those who fought in the Civil War, there are some who, instead, wish to sow discord and discontent.\"\n10: At first glance, Miller\u2019s claim about Confederate veterans is similar to a falsehood that has percolated for years: That the federal government designated Confederate veterans as United States veterans.\n11: Instead, Miller\u2019s statement focuses on two pieces of legislation approved by Congress long after the end of the Civil War.\n12: One required the federal government to place headstones or markers on the graves of Confederate soldiers.\n13: The other allowed veterans and their widows to collect a federal pension.\n14: Todd Smith, a spokesman for Miller, pointed to these pieces of legislation and emphasized that Miller did not go so far as to say Confederate veterans were designated as U.S. veterans.\n15: \"In his post, Commissioner Miller did not state that Confederate veterans had been conferred U.S. veteran status,\" Smith said.\n16: \"Instead, he said that \u2018Confederate veterans were conferred with many of the same benefits of other United States military veterans by Acts of Congress\u2026\u2019 So, these two laws appear to provide benefits to CSA veterans EXACTLY AS IF they had been a U.S. military service member.\"\n17: Post Civil War: No federal benefits At the close of the Civil War, government assistance for Union veterans and Confederate veterans was handled very differently.\n18: In the South, state and county governments were the primary vehicles for offering aid to Confederate veterans and their families, according to Susanah Ural, a professor of history at the University of Southern Mississippi, where she also serves as co-director of the Dale Center for the Study of War and Society.\n19: \"It became a huge issue, because a lot of families had been promised that if the man left or was injured, we\u2019ll make sure the family is taken care of,\" Ural said, noting that states had to allocate significant funds to the effort, considering the high number of fatalities and the families left behind.\n20: Union soldiers and widows received a pension from the federal government and were able to obtain care from federally-run hospitals and homes.\n21: Confederate veterans could not.\n22: \"The federal government was never paying Confederate pensions at that point,\" Ural said.\n23: \"You took up arms against the federal government, so they\u2019re not going to do that.\"\n24: There were also differences when it came to burial.\n25: National cemeteries were originally created to honor Union soldiers, according to the National Park Service.\n26: Confederate veterans could not be buried in these cemeteries, with some exceptions.\n27: Soldiers captured as prisoners of war were buried in designated sections within the cemeteries.\n28: In 1929: Headstones approved for Confederate graves In 1906, the federal government authorized the placement of headstones for Confederate soldiers who were buried in national cemeteries \u2014 a small percentage of all those who died.\n29: It was not until 1929 that Congress authorized Confederate soldiers buried in unmarked graves anywhere to receive \u2014 when requested \u2014 \"appropriate Government headstones or markers at the expense of the United States.\"\n30: In 1958: Federal pensions for veterans, widows By the time Congress authorized federal pensions for Confederate veterans and their widows, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II had come to pass.\n31: It was 1958 (Miller got the year wrong) and the country was in the throws of the Cold War, prompting a wave of reconciliation internally.\n32: \"They made a very big deal about the last surviving veterans on both sides,\" said Barbara Gannon, an associate history professor at the University of Central Florida who specializes in the Civil War and military history.\n33: \"It was about saying: \u2018We\u2019re all real Americans, as opposed to Communists\u2019.\"\n34: Also at this point, the last surviving verified Confederate veteran had died.\n35: Pleasant Crump died in 1951 at the age of 104, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n36: Another man purporting to be a Confederate veteran was still alive, but his status is disputed.\n37: He died in 1959.\n38: News reports from 1958 said there were an estimated 1,500 widows of Confederate soldiers who were still alive and could potentially qualify for the pension.\n39: The last surviving Confederate widow was Maudie Hopkins, who died in 2008 at the age of 93, according to the VA.\n40: But Hopkins did not receive pension benefits after her husband\u2019s death, according to her obituary in the Seattle Times.\n41: The law stated that the Veterans Administration \"shall pay to each person who served in the military or naval forces of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War a monthly pension in the same amounts and subject to the same conditions as would have been applicable to such person ... if his service in such forces had been service in the military or naval service of the United States.\"\n42: But there were no surviving veterans to take advantage of this benefit.\n43: \"It is reasonable to assert that no portion of federal aid ever went to the care of a single Confederate veteran,\" reads an article published on the website for \"The Journal of the Civil War Era\" exploring care offered to veterans after the war.\n44: Even though there were no surviving veterans who claimed the pension offered by the 1958 legislation, Gannon said the effort was more about the push for reconciliation.\n45: \"These were gestures, but they were important gestures to southerners,\" she said.\n46: In a March 1958 column by George Dixon , published in The Evening Independent, then-Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana argued the same point: \"Wouldn\u2019t you think Uncle Sam could afford to make one generous gesture after a hundred years?\"",

                "Similarly, in 1957 (not 1958 as erroneously referred to in some contexts), the Congress enacted a law that the Veterans Administration should pay the same pension to any individual who served in the Confederate army during the Civil War as it would to a person serving in the U.S. military[41][31].",

benefit citizens!\"\n5: The post, which has been shared more than 4,800 times and copied by a slew of users and pages, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n7: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Facebook) The House will decide whether to impeach Trump over actions surrounding a July phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s appointment to an energy board over the next few weeks.\n8: But as for the impeachment inquiry\u2019s price tag, there is no evidence that it has cost $40 million.\n9: That $40 million figure most likely comes from an incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the cost of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n10: The impeachment inquiry centers around actions by Trump that occurred after Mueller\u2019s investigation was completed.\n11: Posts resurface an old number This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard the claim that a public investigation cost $40 million.\n12: After Mueller concluded his special counsel investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, claimed during a Fox News interview that it cost \"about $40 million.\"\n13: Expenditure filings from May 2017 to 2019 put the cost closer to $32 million.\n14: The investigation was paid for through a permanent, indefinite appropriation for independent counsels.\n15: RELATED: Here\u2019s what we know about the cost of the Mueller investigation Mueller\u2019s office said indirect expenses \u2014 such as personnel from the FBI or other agencies \u2014 aren\u2019t really a use of additional tax dollars, since the personnel and resources would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation.\n16: Two notes: First, the cost of the investigation doesn\u2019t account for forfeitures made by people ensnared in the probe.\n17: The financial penalties leveled against Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, stand out among nearly three-dozen indictments stemming from the probe.\n18: As part of a plea agreement, Manafort forfeited to the government his real estate property in New York, funds in three bank accounts, and his life insurance policy.\n19: Court documents do not specify the estimated value of each asset.\n20: (Some news outlets reported that the combined value of the real estate properties could be an estimated $22 million .)\n21: Second, none of Mueller\u2019s findings have been \u2014 to date \u2014 part of the impeachment inquiry.\n22: The inquiry has solely focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine in the time period after Mueller\u2019s investigation had concluded.\n23: No estimate for the inquiry\u2019s cost Tax policy experts told us they aren\u2019t sure how much the impeachment inquiry has cost since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced it Sept. 24.\n24: \"I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019s tried to calculate this cost,\" said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in an email.\n25: We asked the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the investigation, for an estimate of how much it has spent on the impeachment inquiry.\n26: We did not hear back.\n27: One potential way to determine the approximate cost of the impeachment inquiry would be to add up the salaries of staffers on the relevant committees.\n28: According to LegiStorm , a congressional research website, salary expenditures for staffers on the Intelligence Committee totaled $2.4 million as of June.\n29: In 2018, salaries surpassed $5 million.\n30: If you factor in staff salaries for the Judiciary Committee, which will weigh in on the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation in the House, the total comes to around $5.7 million as of June.\n31: But that number still doesn\u2019t tell us a lot about the cost of the inquiry.\n32: RELATED: Fact-checking Trump, Ukraine impeachment hearings, day 1 Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense, said there isn\u2019t much congressional spending.\n33: \"All the members and staff would have been paid regardless.\n34: There are costs of transcription of the hearings, but that\u2019s about all I can think of,\" he said in an email.\n35: \"For the executive branch there are the costs of having witnesses travel from overseas in the case of Ambassadors (Gordon) Sondland and (William) Taylor (if that is the case).\n36: And there are costs for additional attorneys at the White House to work on impeachment.\"\n37: Politico reported that more than a dozen Trump administration officials have hired attorneys that typically earn between $1,000 and $1,500 per hour.\n38: But they were paid for by the Republican National Committee, officials themselves or through a legal defense fund \u2014\u00a0not with taxpayer money.\n39: As for the witnesses that will appear in upcoming impeachment hearings, it\u2019s unclear what their travel expenses will be.\n40: But there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019d cost tens of millions of dollars.\n41: What past impeachments\u00a0cost Past impeachments could shed some light on the potential cost.\n42: But there\u2019s not a lot to go off of.\n43: A 1998 report to Congress estimated that the cost of former special counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation of former President Bill Clinton had \"just shy of $30 million.\"\n44: The investigation, which centered on Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, resulted in his impeachment in the House.\n45: RELATED: Johnson, Nixon, Clinton, Trump: 9 questions about impeachment Later media reports placed the cost somewhere between $47 million and $50 million .\n46: Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr as head of the Office of the Independent Counsel, told the Associated Press in 2002 that about $12.5 million was spent on the perjury and obstruction probe of Clinton and his relationship with Lewinsky.\n47: But the Starr investigation lasted several years and looked into multiple aspects of the Clinton presidency, such as the Whitewater scandal.\n48: And it was independent of Congress, making it more similar to Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in 2016 (which was slightly less expensive, when adjusting for inflation) than the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine.",

Smith said.\n43: \"The state is not tracking it, nor do I think there is any way for them to track it.\"",

        "passage": "0: In a Facebook ad that started running Nov. 14, the day after the first public hearing of the impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump declared: \"Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office.\"\n1: Did the two California House members \u2014 Speaker Pelosi and impeachment inquiry leader Schiff \u2014 and other Democrats pledge to impeach Trump even before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017?\n2: We found no evidence of it.\n3: In fact, Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats for the current impeachment inquiry.\n4: Talk, but no promises There was some early talk about possible impeachment.\n5: In April 2016 \u2014 before Trump even won the GOP nomination \u2014 Politico reported that there was talk of impeaching Trump soon after he took office, were he to be nominated for the presidency and win.\n6: Then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson , D-Fla., said at the time that if Trump insisted on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border despite Congress\u2019s opposition, his actions could lead down a path toward impeachment.\n7: In December 2016, five Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, announced they would introduce a bill to require Trump to divest assets that could pose a conflict of interest in his role as president.\n8: They said the legislation would symbolically make violations of federal conflict-of-interest rules \"a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S.\n9: Constitution.\"\n10: But those are only examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment \u2014 far short of promising to do it.\n11: And Pelosi and Schiff were not involved.\n12: Trump\u2019s evidence The same is true of two statements cited to us by the Republican National Committee to back Trump\u2019s claim in the ad.\n13: (The ad, by the way, was placed by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee , a joint fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n14: As of Sept. 30, 2019, it had raised more than $96 million during 2019, according to the latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.)\n15: 1\n16: A Schiff tweet on Dec. 22, 2016, said: \"There\u2019s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS \u2013 including Trump.\n17: Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment.\"\n18: The Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities and is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump\u2019s Washington hotel.\n19: It has rarely been tested in court.\n20: At the time, the federal Office of Government Ethics was urging Trump to sell his business holdings as the \"only way to resolve these conflicts of interest.\"\n21: Similarly, Schiff was calling on the president-elect to \"divest completely,\" raising impeachment as one possible consequence if Trump didn\u2019t, but not pledging to impeach.\n22: 2\n23: U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters , another California Democrat, said four days before the inauguration that if there was evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians by using hacked information from Democratic National Committee emails against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, it would be an impeachable offense.\n24: Waters has repeatedly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but those demands didn\u2019t start until the months after Trump took office .\n25: The RNC didn\u2019t provide us any information about Pelosi.\n26: A Pelosi spokesman denied to us that Pelosi ever promised before Trump took office that she would seek to impeach him.\n27: It\u2019s also important to note that Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry.\n28: Pelosi launched the inquiry, in September 2019, only after evidence emerged Trump allegedly pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden , a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son.",

        "passage": "0: Former Fox News Radio host Todd Starnes said that a school district in Texas is requiring \"teaching kids how to have anal sex,\" after the Austin school district board voted to adopt new sex education curriculum for elementary and middle school students.\n1: In an Oct. 29\u00a0 post on his website, Starnes described the new curriculum and relied on information from Texas Values, a conservative organization that opposed the new instruction materials.\n2: \"In spite of overwhelming opposition from parents and pastors, the district\u2019s trustees voted early Tuesday morning to implement a pornographic sex education policy that includes instruction on anal sex and how to place a condom on an erect penis,\" he wrote.\n3: This is a largely inaccurate description of the new curriculum.\n4: The lessons include instructions on condom use, but they do not include detailed information on anal sex or any pornographic materials.\n5: Starnes did not return a request for comment.\n6: Reviewing the new curriculum The Austin school board approved new sex education curriculum for elementary and middle school students at the end of October.\n7: The curriculum includes instruction about sexual orientation, gender identity and sexually transmitted diseases for the first time in the district, starting as early as fifth grade.\n8: It also includes lessons about healthy relationships, puberty and reproduction, according to the American-Statesman .\n9: Any student in the district can be exempted from participating in some or all of the lessons that fall under the umbrella of \"Human Sexuality and Responsibility Curriculum\" at the request of a parent or guardian, according to the school district\u2019s policy .\n10: The school board voted unanimously to approve the new curriculum, despite resistance from some conservative organizations, including Texas Values.\n11: The board heard public feedback on the issue before voting, and roughly 69% of those who spoke disapproved of the changes, according to the American-Statesman .\n12: Is new curriculum \u2018pornographic\u2019?\n13: All of the instructional materials and student handouts for the human sexuality curriculum for third through fifth grades and sixth through eighth grades are available on the school district\u2019s website.\n14: Instruction materials for third through fifth grades include anatomical drawings depicting the internal anatomy of both the male and female reproductive systems.\n15: Materials for sixth through eighth grade include drawings of internal and external anatomy for both reproductive systems.\n16: Pornography is defined by Merriam-Webster as \"the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement.\"\n17: Medical images and educational materials are generally not considered pornography.\n18: Megan Maas, an assistant professor of human development and family studies at Michigan State University, reviewed the new curriculum at the request of PolitiFact Texas and said that it \"clearly does not meet the definition of pornography.\"\n19: \"It seems comprehensive enough to give students the language they need to enforce the decisions they want to make around sexual behavior,\" she said in an email.\n20: \"Even maintaining abstinence requires comprehensive education so that they have the language and skills to refuse some kinds of sexual behavior (e.g.\n21: oral sex), but engage in others (e.g.\n22: holding hands).\"\n23: Most importantly: Texas law prohibits the distribution or display of \"harmful materials\" to minors \u2014 including pornography.\n24: Does curriculum include instruction on anal sex, condom placement?\n25: The bulk of the sex education lessons for both third through fifth graders and sixth through eighth graders focuses on personal identity and safety as well as identifying and maintaining healthy relationships with family, friends and romantic partners.\n26: There are also lessons on anatomy, puberty and the reproductive system, as well as abstinence, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.\n27: Austin is considered an \"abstinence-plus\" district, meaning that lessons encourage abstinence but also discuss other methods of preventing pregnancy and diseases.\n28: In addition to lessons on abstinence in the new materials, there are also lessons about other contraceptive methods, but those are limited to sixth through eighth grade instruction.\n29: Seventh and eighth grade lessons include information about how to use a male condom , with drawings accompanied by descriptive text.\n30: The materials are produced by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n31: Starnes also said that the new lessons include instruction on anal sex.\n32: Anal sex is mentioned briefly in the curriculum on a list of commonly recognized types of sexual activity and separately as one of the possible vehicles for sexually transmitted diseases.\n33: None of the materials include a detailed description of anal sex or instructions.",

Kamala Harris sounds in her 2020 presidential campaign is that \"justice is on the ballot.\"\n1: The California Democrat did so repeatedly in a Facebook video ad , which leads off with this claim: \"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\"\n2: Her statement is based on a study that produced startling headlines , such as one in the Washington Post: \"For the first time in history, U.S. billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class last year.\"\n3: But Harris misfired by making her claim about taxes paid instead of tax rates.\n4: Also, the study, while produced by two prominent economists, makes estimates based on assumptions that are not universally accepted among economists.\n5: The study The study, published as a book about a month before Harris\u2019 claim, was done by leading economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, whose work PolitiFact has relied on for previous fact-checks.\n6: Harris\u2019 campaign told us Harris was referring to rates, even though that isn\u2019t what Harris said.\n7: The study said that in 2018, the average effective tax rate paid by the bottom half of American households was 24.2% \u2014 a full percentage point higher than the 23% rate paid by the 400 richest families.\n8: As the book puts it, \"the Trumps, the Zuckerbergs and the Buffetts of this world pay lower tax rates than teachers and secretaries.\"\n9: So, to use Harris\u2019 example, a typical father with two jobs pays a higher tax rate than the richest 400 American families \u2014 according to one study by prominent economists.\n10: That\u2019s not the same as paying more taxes.\n11: Indeed, an individual with $1 million in taxable income would pay roughly $230,000 in all federal and state taxes, Howard Gleckman , a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us.\n12: Someone with $50,000 in taxable income would pay about $12,000.\n13: Criticism of the study Moreover, the study Harris relied on makes estimates for 2018, and its methodology has come in for criticism from some economists.\n14: That isn\u2019t to say that the study is wrong or that the critics are right.\n15: But the picture isn\u2019t as clear as Harris\u2019 statement suggests.\n16: Federal tax data for 2018 were not available, so the Saez-Zucman study had to do extrapolations, Gleckman wrote in a critique of the study.\n17: That is \"no easy feat,\" because of fundamental changes made by the 2017 Republican tax cuts; plus, the study excluded certain federal tax credits received by lower- and middle-income people.\n18: The upshot, according to Gleckman: Incomes of the very rich are rising faster than for all other income groups, and Trump\u2019s tax law cut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low- and moderate-income households; \"but that doesn\u2019t mean that billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class.\"\n19: A similar criticism was made by economists Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute and Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation.\n20: The Saez-Zucman study, they wrote , \"rests on several unconventional methodological assumptions which, in our opinion, biases the outcome towards finding relatively lower tax rates on the wealthy compared to the poor and overstates the decline in top earners\u2019 tax burdens.\"\n21: David Splinter , an economist at Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, also found fault with the Saez-Zucman study\u2019s methodology and conclusion that tax rates are nearly equal for people at opposite ends of the income scale.\n22: The joint committee, the Tax Policy Center, the U.S. Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office and economists all have found that federal taxes are progressive, he wrote in a critique of the study.\n23: The study\u2019s assumptions, Tax Foundation economist Erica York told us, \"go against the widely-accepted methods that exist for determining tax burdens, without providing a convincing reason for doing so.\"\n24: Saez referred us to a frequently asked questions web page that explains the study\u2019s rationale and addresses some of the criticism.\n25: University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky praised the study, but called Harris\u2019 claim misleading.\n26: \"In dollar terms, the father holding down two jobs is certainly paying less in taxes than the taxes paid by the richest families,\" Reschovsky told us.\n27: \"What Harris should have said, is that the father holding down two jobs is paying a larger share of his income in taxes than the average richest families are paying in taxes relative to their incomes.\"\n28: But, again, that scenario comes from a study that is in some dispute.",

        "passage": "0: The latest ousted U.S. official to feel the wrath of the president\u2019s loyalists is Marie Yovanovitch.\n1: In April, she was abruptly removed from her job as ambassador to Ukraine in response to pressure from the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n2: (Giuliani and other former Ukrainian officials stood to lose from her anti-corruption initiatives.)\n3: Now, Yovanovitch is a key witness in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n4: The president\u2019s supporters have tried to discredit Yovanovitch \u2014 and the entire probe, for that matter.\n5: U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from western North Carolina who chaired the conservative Freedom Caucus, recently brushed off Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as routine.\n6: In a tweet following Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 15, Meadows wrote: \"For Washington Democrats and pundits who are incredulous that @realDonaldTrump recalled an ambassador, certain that it must be evidence of a conspiracy\u2026 President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election.\"\n7: We wondered whether it was true that Obama fired all of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors.\n8: It\u2019s typical for incoming presidents to replace politically-appointed ambassadors There are two breeds of ambassadors: political appointees and career diplomats.\n9: Political appointees are usually stationed in countries that are U.S. allies or desirable locations, like the Bahamas .\n10: These plum jobs are often awarded to the president\u2019s friends and donors.\n11: They step aside when a new president is elected.\n12: Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University, said, \"It is customary for political ambassadors to rotate out within the first several months of a change in administration precisely because one of their top assets \u2014 their closeness to the occupant of the Oval Office \u2014 disappears with the departing president.\"\n13: Those are the people who cycled out when Obama took office.\n14: That\u2019s standard practice.\n15: In his tweet, Meadows linked to a Washington Post article from Dec. 2008 to back up his claim.\n16: The article said that the Obama administration told all of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors to vacate their posts by Jan. 20.\n17: But we found at least a couple of examples of Bush\u2019s politically-appointed ambassadors staying in their posts past Inauguration Day, which also is standard practice.\n18: One example: Bush appointee Victor Ashe told PolitiFact that the Obama team asked him to continue serving as ambassador to Poland until his successor was confirmed.\n19: He ended up staying for nine months into Obama\u2019s first term.\n20: \"I was flattered,\" Ashe said.\n21: \"I thought it was a tribute to my service, that I acted in a nonpartisan way.\"\n22: A Snopes article from 2017 concluded, \"We found similar examples of presidents allowing ambassadors appointed by their predecessors to remain at their posts past Inauguration Day for every presidential transition dating back to 1977, when Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford.\"\n23: So, it\u2019s not accurate to say that Obama \"fired every Bush appointed ambassador.\"\n24: Indeed, he wasn\u2019t even the one to ask for their resignations.\n25: Ashe told us that the ambassadors received notice from the Bush White House requesting a letter of resignation effective Jan. 20, 2009.\n26: In routine fashion, they obliged.\n27: Many of Bush\u2019s political appointees left their posts by Inauguration Day, but Ashe and some others were asked to withdraw their resignations and stay on during the transition, Ashe said.\n28: But Yovanovitch\u2019s removal wasn\u2019t routine It\u2019s important to note that Yovanovitch\u2019s case is different.\n29: She is a career diplomat, not a political appointee, who has served under three presidents.\n30: Also, she was ousted more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, not during a transition period.\n31: Career diplomats hold the majority of ambassadorships.\n32: They are foreign service officers who rose through the ranks, often serving for decades before becoming ambassadors.\n33: While it\u2019s customary for political appointees to cycle out when a new president takes office, career diplomats usually stay in their posts.\n34: In his tweet, Meadows tried to characterize Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as routine \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 criticisms about Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster as invalid.\n35: But he\u2019s applying the practice of replacing political appointees \u2014 and wrongly characterizing what Obama did, to a large extent \u2014 to career diplomats.",

One program, promoting nutrition for older adults through farmers' markets,\u00a0is available in 44 states, including New York.\n25: There are different ways to define and count \"welfare\" programs.\n26: A 2013 report from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, counted 126 separate federal anti-poverty programs, either means-tested assistance or those with an explicit purpose in fighting poverty.\n27: In 2012 congressional testimony ,\u00a0the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said it counted 79 federal means-tested welfare programs.\n28: Regardless of how think tanks count the programs, there\u2019s no doubt New York is generous compared with other states.\n29: In Cato\u2019s analysis, New York ranked seventh among states for the total value of welfare benefits.\n30: It also found that New York ranks third most-generous in the value of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the primary cash benefit for the poor.\n31: But TANF, which is distributed through block grant\u00a0to all states, has not changed since 1996 .\n32: States have flexibility in how they use the funds\u00a0and can use it for programs other than cash assistance, such as child welfare or preschool.\n33: The annual funding level of $16.5 billion was set in 1996 and has not changed.\n34: Inflation has reduced the program's real value by 40 percent since then, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.\n35: Angela Rachidi , a research fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that favors free enterprise, said DiPietro\u2019s claim is possibly true.\n36: But she\u2019s not sure where he got his numbers from.\n37: It is true the federal government authorizes programs and gives states flexibility in how to deliver them, said Rachidi, who worked in human resources administration in New York City\u2019s Department of Social Services.\n38: \"The general perception is true that New York is a very generous state,\" she said.\n39: Medicaid choices Some experts suggested DiPietro might be talking about Medicaid.\n40: Without a response from DiPietro, we can\u2019t be sure.\n41: Medicaid, the health care program for people who have low incomes or disabilities, is designed differently in every state.\n42: There are 15 mandatory benefits , including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, as well as optional benefits\u00a0that vary by state, such as hospice, eyeglasses\u00a0and podiatry services.\n43: States can decide how generous each benefit will be, like\u00a0whether to require\u00a0a co-pay or set a limit on services.\n44: The Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonpartisan organization that analyzes health policy, surveyed all 50 states in 2018 about the Medicaid benefits they offer.\n45: The foundation asked about 47 different benefits, 14\u00a0of which are mandatory.\n46: Of the remaining 33 benefits, New York offers all of them.\n47: New York also offers services that were not part of KFF's survey, such as fertility services and lactation services .\n48: To see how New York compared with other states, we looked at the 33\u00a0optional benefits included in the survey.\n49: We found that, on average,\u00a0the 44 states that participated in the survey offered 26\u00a0optional benefits.\n50: Alabama and Virginia had the fewest, with 15 optional benefits.\n51: New Jersey and Minnesota offered 32.\n52: New York\u00a0did not respond to the KFF survey, but we researched Medicaid benefit information from the state Department of Health and the state's official Medicaid plan .\n53: New York\u2019s Medicaid spending has always been high, if not the highest, among other states.\n54: In 2015, per capita spending on Medicaid was highest in New York, and 76 percent above the national average, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank.",

Trump Foundation, Trump (who founded the foundation and served as its president), and his three eldest children (who served on the board of directors).\n11: The lawsuit charged that the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws and that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests.\n12: The foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve.\n13: Earlier this month, on Nov. 7, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced she\u2019d reached a settlement in the lawsuit and that the New York Supreme Court ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages \"for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests.\"\n14: The settlement outlined several matters Trump agreed to.\n15: But the part that is most pertinent to this claim relates to early 2016, when Trump said that in lieu of attending a Republican primary debate he would hold a fundraiser for veterans in Iowa.\n16: Trump in the settlement agreed that his political campaign planned, organized, and paid for the fundraiser, with the administrative assistance of the foundation.\n17: Further, he agreed that the campaign \"directed the timing, amounts, and recipients of the foundation\u2019s grants to charitable organizations supporting military veterans.\"\n18: The event raised about $5.6 million in donations intended for veterans\u2019 groups \u2014 about $2.8 million of that went to Trump\u2019s foundation and the rest was donated directly to veterans\u2019 groups.\n19: Trump even presented foundation checks to veterans\u2019 groups during his campaign events.\n20: However, we find nothing in the settlement terms that suggests Trump admitted to illegally diverting those funds away from veterans, as Buttigieg claimed.\n21: Trump \"breached his fiduciary duty\" to the foundation by allowing his campaign to \"orchestrate\" the Iowa fundraiser and by \"using the fundraiser and distribution of the funds to further\" his political campaign, New York Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla said Nov. 7.\n22: \"I find that the $2,823,000 raised at the fundraiser was used for Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign staff, rather than by the foundation\" in violation of state laws, Scarpulla wrote.\n23: However, she added, \"the funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.\"",

As Trump toured the production plant on Wednesday, Apple started construction on its $1 billion corporate campus in Austin, the latest expansion in the city.\n10: The campus will house a number of company operations, including engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support, according to the Austin American-Statesman.\n11: It is expected to open in 2022 and have 5,000 employees.\n12: During his trip to Austin, Trump did not visit the new location nor will it be a manufacturing plant.\n13: Mac Pro in Austin Apple has produced its Mac Pro desktop computers in Austin since 2013 at the Flextronics Americas factory in Northwest Austin.\n14: The computer has always been designed and engineered in California, and its components are produced in different states and other countries.\n15: Final assembly of the product happens in Austin, according to the company.\n16: In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would move the manufacturing of its new Mac Pro models from Austin to China, citing capacity challenges at the Austin plant.\n17: Another concern for the tech company was the Trump administration\u2019s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods, which were expected to affect imports of certain materials needed for the Mac Pro.\n18: The company asked the Trump administration in July to exclude from the tariffs components needed for its \"completely redesigned\" Mac Pro, according to Bloomberg .\n19: Days later, Trump shut down the request in a tweet : \"Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China.\n20: Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\"\n21: But in September, the U.S. trade representative agreed to grant the exemption, and Apple announced that it would continue to use the Austin facility for Mac Pro assembly.\n22: The facility has about 500 workers and has been the company's only major device assemblage operation\u00a0in the United States, according to Bloomberg .\n23: Most of Apple's products are produced and assembled in China.",

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n2: Text written over the images claims the trio has not been very productive during their government careers.\n3: \"67 combined years.\n4: 6 bills passed,\" the post reads.\n5: This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n7: It has been shared thousands of times by several different users and pages.\n8: Like past social media posts , this one is inaccurate.\n9: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Screenshot from Facebook) Let\u2019s look at the first claim \u2014\u00a0that Sanders, Pelosi and Waters have served a combined 67 years in Congress.\n10: Sanders was first elected to Congress in 1991 and has served as both a representative and senator.\n11: Pelosi was elected in 1987 and has served as both a representative and speaker of the House.\n12: Waters has served as a representative since 1991.\n13: When combined, the three lawmakers have served 88 years in Congress \u2014\u00a0actually more than the Facebook post claims.\n14: On the second claim, the Facebook post also falls flat.\n15: According to GovTrack , a website that keeps tabs on congressional legislation, the lawmakers mentioned in the post have passed more than six bills.\n16: For this fact-check, we first used the most stringent definition of the word \"passed\" \u2014 legislation that is \"enacted,\" or signed by the president \u2014 to assess the validity of the post.\n17: Then we looked at how many sponsored bills had passed at least one chamber of Congress.\n18: Here is each lawmaker\u2019s legislative record as of Nov. 17: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n19: Passed : 2 Enacted : 3 Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n20: Passed : 9 Enacted : 7 Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.\n21: Passed : 23 Enacted : 3 That puts the lawmakers\u2019 combined enacted bills at 13 \u2014\u00a0not six, as the Facebook post claimed.\n22: However, experts have told us that counting enacted bills is not the only nor the best way to measure lawmaker productivity.\n23: \"Very few bills are ever enacted \u2014 most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law,\" reads a notice on the GovTrack site.\n24: \"But there are other legislative activities that we don\u2019t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\"\n25: Additionally, Pelosi has served as House speaker for seven years, nonconsecutively.\n26: That role is more focused on setting the party\u2019s agenda than actually introducing bills, according to GovTrack.\n27: The Facebook post is inaccurate.",

        "passage": "0: A Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in North Carolina wants to send a clear message: he won\u2019t be a tool for big businesses.\n1: Cal Cunningham, who\u2019s campaigning to be the Democratic nominee against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, says he won\u2019t take money from corporate political action committees.\n2: \"That means this campaign is funded by people like you -- not the special interests,\" he tweeted on July 31.\n3: Is it true that Cunningham has received no donations from special interests?\n4: PolitiFact has investigated similar claims by former Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke , Congressman Conor Lamb and, in North Carolina more recently, congressional candidate Kathy Manning .\n5: While it\u2019s true that Cunningham hasn\u2019t received money from corporate PACs, he has received money from business executives and PACs that receive money from corporations.\n6: Corporate PACs The Center for Responsive Politics tracks donations of all types, including political action committees (PACs.)\n7: PACs are generally put into three categories: business, labor and ideological.\n8: The CRP\u2019s campaign tracker backs up Cunningham\u2019s claim that hasn\u2019t accepted money from business PACs .\n9: That\u2019s not necessarily a significant sacrifice for Cunningham, according to Brendan Quinn, CRP\u2019s outreach and social media manager.\n10: \"Corporate PACs don\u2019t usually give that much to challengers,\" Quinn said.\n11: When those PACs do donate to Democrats, he said they typically give to those in safe districts.\n12: \"Not much would go to a Democrat trying to swing a Senate seat in a purple state,\" he said.\n13: Cunningham has received $10,000 from labor PACs, $22,590 from ideological PACs, and even more from PACs tied to Democrats in the U.S. Senate.\n14: And that\u2019s where Cunningham\u2019s claim comes into question.\n15: He\u2019s received money from PACs that get some of their money from corporations.\n16: Other PACs Cunningham has received thousands from PACs tied to individual senators, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n17: For example, Cunningham received $10,000 from Forward Together PAC , which is affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.\n18: According to CRP, Forward Together has received money from employees of Amazon, Microsoft, and other big corporations.\n19: Cunningham also received $10,000 from Motor City PAC , affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan.\n20: Motor City recently received $5,000 donations from American Express, Charter Communications, Comcast, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, General Motors, Goldman Sachs and other large corporations.\n21: So, even if Cunningham has shunned corporate PACs, may have received money that originated with a corporation.\n22: Some experts consider that degree of separation that some experts consider significant.\n23: Andrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher for the CRP, told PolitiFact last year that candidates who receive money from a Senate PAC money are more likely to feel indebted to the Senator than the company who donated to the senator\u2019s PAC.\n24: In some cases, though, there\u2019s no separation between Cunningham and corporate leaders.\n25: Cunningham has received thousands of dollars from corporate executives.\n26: CEO money He received big individual donations from the CEO of a financial consulting group , the founder of a pharmaceutical company , and the president of Blue Shield California , among others.\n27: End Citizens United, a group that aims to reduce the influence of money in politics, sees a distinction between receiving money from corporate CEOs and from corporate PACs.\n28: The PAC exists to benefit a company, while the motivation of an individual CEO is often unclear.\n29: \"Individuals can give to candidates for any reason,\" said Patrick Burwinkle, spokesman for End Citizens United.\n30: \"That candidate could align with (the CEOs) values,\" from reproductive rights to foreign policy and other issues.\n31: \"And that's why - unlike Senator Tillis - Cal has taken and followed a pledge against taking corporate PAC money while also releasing a comprehensive anti-corruption plan that would reform Washington's broken political system,\" said Rachel Petri, spokeswoman for Cunningham.\n32: Some, however, don\u2019t see much of a difference in who the money is coming from.\n33: Corporate PACs are funded by the corporations\u2019 employees, not the organization itself.\n34: \"Every dime that goes into a pac is an individual dime, it\u2019s just pooled resources,\" Cleta Mitchell, a conservative campaign-finance and election-law attorney told The Atlantic last year .\n35: Michael Williams, founder of the public policy and communications consulting firm The Williams Group, explained his skepticism to Fortune Magazine earlier this year.\n36: \"What\u2019s the difference?\n37: If you won\u2019t take a particular bank\u2019s money, but you\u2019ll take the bank executive\u2019s money?\"\n38: Williams told Fortune.\n39: \"Are you really materially changing anything?\"",

        "passage": "0: In September 2018 , Nike announced an endorsement deal with former NFL quarterback and activist Colin Kaepernick.\n1: Since then, claims about the company\u2019s labor practices have flooded the internet, attracting thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter.\n2: Many of these viral posts feature a photo of Nike factory workers accompanied by a claim that the company exploits workers with long hours and abysmally low wages.\n3: (Most posts are screenshots of a September 2018 tweet by conservative commentator Ryan Fournier.)\n4: The posts say: \"Just so I'm clear: These factory workers (which are 80% female) are making NIKE's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay Colin Kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice?\"\n5: The Associated Press photo accompanying the post is legitimate, though quite old.\n6: It shows Vietnamese workers putting finishing touches on Nike shoes at a factory in Ho Chi Minh City in February 2005.\n7: The posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n8: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n9: It is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week.\n10: While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages.\n11: Let\u2019s take a look.\n12: Investigations into Nike\u2019s Vietnamese factories in the 1990s In October 1996, CBS\u2019 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam.\n13: The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked \"six days a week for only $40 a month,\" which translated to about 20 cents an hour.\n14: An investigation by Dara O\u2019Rourke , a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike.\n15: According to the investigation, the plant\u2019s night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40.\n16: A 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits.\n17: The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements: \"Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops.\n18: In 1999, Nike implemented its own \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 in Vietnamese factories.\n19: During recent years, there has been a visible improvement in VT\u2019s practices, such as safer work conditions and workers\u2019 awareness of their rights and entitlements.\"\n20: What about now?\n21: PolitiFact reached out to the Clean Clothes Campaign , an alliance of labor unions that focuses on improving working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries.\n22: The organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours, aren\u2019t precise but\u00a0 the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct: Factory workers for Nike \u2013\u2013 and other major sportswear brands such as Adidas and Under Armour \u2013\u2013 do not earn \"anywhere near a living wage.\"\n23: They confirmed that the claim of 80% of factory workers being women lines up with industry estimates, which have been as high as 85%.\n24: Clean Clothes also pointed us to a June 2019 report that surveyed top brands about their progress in implementing a living wage for workers and said most brands \u2013\u2013 Nike included \u2013\u2013 provided no evidence that their workers anywhere in the world were being paid a living wage.\n25: Research from 2014 shows that, in most of the Southeast Asian countries that Nike sources from, wages reach around 25% of a living wage.\n26: Paul Roeland, a campaign coordinator with the Clean Clothes Campaign, told PolitiFact that, when it comes to working hours, most workers have a contract to work 48 hours a week but regularly continue working beyond that, often up to 60 hours a week.\n27: He said the hours fluctuate and are often longer during peak production times.\n28: \"The factual numbers are shocking enough: it would come down to between 65-90 cents (USD) per hour (depending on the country), and regular 60-hour work weeks,\" Roeland told PolitiFact by email.\n29: That said, he bristled at the overall message in this viral post: \"At Clean Clothes Campaign, our aim is in supporting garment workers worldwide, as it has been over the past 30 years,\" Roeland said.\n30: \"However, we strongly believe that criticizing Nike's labour practices with the sole aim of disparaging the anti-racist activism of others, as some right-wing U.S. political figures are doing, is highly disingenuous.\n31: Garment workers deserve so much better than to be used as a handy argument in a social media meme.\"\n32: PolitiFact reached out to Nike for a response but did not hear back in time for publication.\n33: Nike\u2019s code of conduct for supplier facilities reads, \"the regular work week shall not exceed 48 hours\" and suppliers should \"allow workers at least 24 consecutive hours of rest in every seven-day period.\n34: All overtime work shall be consensual.\n35: Suppliers shall not request overtime on a regular basis and shall compensate all overtime work at a premium rate.\n36: Other than in extraordinary circumstances, the sum of regular and overtime hours in a week shall not exceed 60 hours.\"\n37: It\u2019s important to note that Nike isn\u2019t alone.\n38: While wages and hours for factory workers vary from country to country, many major companies use the same factories and all pay the same low wages for their workers.\n39: Experts tell us that while it depends on the country and the volume of production, violation of legal overtime standards is common in the garment industry.",

        "passage": "0: During a recent sit-down interview at a local business forum, Democratic Gov.\n1: J.B. Pritzker dismissed the possibility of changing the Illinois constitution to make it possible to reduce public retiree benefits.\n2: Echoing growing calls from certain groups to ask voters next year to eliminate the clause that protects those benefits, the moderator at the event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago asked Pritzker why he won\u2019t promote such a plan as part of his broader push to shore up the state\u2019s finances.\n3: In response, he argued there are other ways to help fill the state\u2019s massive pension hole.\n4: One of his examples caught our attention: \"In the spring, we expanded a program to buy out \u2014 a voluntary program \u2014 to buy out retirees when they\u2019re retiring at 60% of what their pensions would be,\" Pritzker said .\n5: \"People are choosing to take the money up front.\n6: It\u2019s saving the state money.\n7: In fact, a study was done of what the savings would be and it\u2019s billions and billions, potentially $25 billion of savings.\n8: And by the way, people are choosing it \u2014 almost 20% of people who are retiring are choosing that buyout.\"\n9: Illinois\u2019 unfunded liability \u2014 the gap between its pension assets and the benefits it has committed to pay future retirees \u2014 is nearly $137 billion , largely due to decades of underfunding by public officials .\n10: And $25 billion sounds like it could go a long way toward addressing that shortfall.\n11: But Pritzker left a lot of questions unanswered.\n12: He didn\u2019t provide a timeframe for those savings, nor was it clear from his remarks which program he was describing or what study determined it could save the state billions.\n13: So we decided to find out.\n14: Unpacking Pritzker\u2019s claim In response to our inquiry, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said the governor was referencing two programs that allow some participants in the state\u2019s three largest retirement systems to forego certain benefits in exchange for an upfront payment.\n15: Both buyout programs were created as part of the 2018 state budget and were extended in the budget Pritzker signed this year to June 30, 2024 from their original sunset date in mid-2021.\n16: But each program is more limited than what the governor described.\n17: One program allows people who formerly worked for the state \u2014 including its public schools and universities \u2014 long enough to qualify for a state pension and who have not yet begun to draw from it to trade all rights to a future retirement benefit in exchange for a lump sum equal to 60% of the total lifetime pension they would have received.\n18: Despite being a total buyout worth the same percentage Pritzker referenced, this program applies to a much smaller subset of state retirement system members than his comment suggests.\n19: The other program permits retiring members who were hired before 2011 to trade the 3% compounded automatic annual increase to which they are entitled under the state\u2019s two-tiered pension structure for an annual increase of 1.5% on the original value of their pension, which would not be compounded.\n20: In exchange, they receive a lump sum equal to 70% of the difference between the value of the higher and lower annual increases.\n21: In short, it is not a total pension buyout.\n22: So far, participation and cost savings associated with both programs has been limited.\n23: Out of 3,600 qualified inactive members of the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System (SERS), which covers state employees who do not work in public education or for the judicial and legislative branches, 22 have elected to take a total buyout since it became an option for those members in 2018, according to a spokesman.\n24: At the Teachers Retirement System of Illinois (TRS), 297 out of 14,598 eligible members have decided to participate, a spokesman for that system told us.\n25: The participation rate was higher for the accelerated annual increase program.\n26: Since last December, 719 out of 2,889 retiring Tier 1 SERS members have elected to take it, for a participation rate of nearly 25%, according to SERS.\n27: At TRS, which covers employees at public schools outside Chicago, 596 \u2014 or 16% \u2014 of the system\u2019s 3,715 eligible retiring members opted for it this year.\n28: For context, however, there are roughly 61,000 retired SERS members and 64,000 current employees.\n29: TRS, the state\u2019s largest system, has about 112,000 retirees currently drawing benefits and 163,000 current employees.\n30: \"The statement makes it sound like a large portion of people are taking these options and it\u2019s important to realize that it\u2019s a limited pool who\u2019s even eligible for these buyout programs,\" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago and an expert on state and local pensions.\n31: We did not receive a response from the third major state pension fund, the State Universities Retirement System, by publication time.\n32: As for Pritzker\u2019s contention that the buyouts would save the state billions, his spokeswoman said the governor was presented with an independent analysis that came to that conclusion.\n33: However, she declined to provide the study itself or offer any further details about where it came from and what it was based on.\n34: \"The governor was referencing a proprietary study conducted by and for an outside organization that he was presented,\" Abudayyeh wrote in an email.\n35: \"It determined that pension buyouts, depending on the structure of the options, have the potential to save billions, including as much as roughly $25 billion.\n36: The administration has not yet determined its estimate, nor did the governor say that this was the administration\u2019s estimate for how much money buyouts are currently saving or will save.\"\n37: Without access to the study, we cannot confirm Pritzker\u2019s comments square with its findings.\n38: This July, however, a budget watchdog group published an analysis finding the programs had \"generated relatively minor savings\" in the last fiscal year.\n39: While the programs were expected to save the state more than $400 million that year, they generated just $13 million in savings for the state\u2019s general fund, the Civic Federation found.\n40: As the group\u2019s analysis notes, the original state estimate overstated the potential savings because it was based on an actuarial review of a different buyout proposal that extended through 2045.\n41: \"It seems like these programs are going to save the state some money, but it\u2019s likely to be much less than people may have thought,\" said Kass, the state pension expert.",

John Kennedy, R-La., argued that Ukraine tried to undermine Donald Trump in the 2016 election, so Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukraine and delay nearly $400 million in military aid.\n1: There\u2019s no question that some Ukraine officials publicly objected to comments then-candidate Trump made about Russia annexing Crimea, about 10,000 square miles of what had been Ukrainian territory.\n2: Trump cast the Russian land grab essentially as a done deal.\n3: But Kennedy said the Ukrainian response went beyond a few officials.\n4: He said the Ukrainian anti-Trump effort came from the very top.\n5: \"Russia was very aggressive, and they're much more sophisticated,\" Kennedy told NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd Dec. 1 .\n6: \"But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that (former) President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton.\"\n7: Todd pushed back, noting the only person pushing that theory is Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n8: \"Wait a minute, Senator Kennedy, you now have the president of Ukraine saying he actively worked for the Democratic nominee for president,\" Todd said.\n9: \"I mean, now come on.\"\n10: Kennedy invited Todd to read news reports, especially articles from The Economist magazine.\n11: \"Do you believe The Economist magazine is a reputable journal?\"\n12: Kennedy said.\n13: \"It's been around, I think, since 1843.\"\n14: Kennedy\u2019s office sent us a list of eight articles to support Kennedy\u2019s claim.\n15: None of them back him up.\n16: Given Kennedy\u2019s focus on the work of The Economist, it\u2019s noteworthy that little in The Economist\u2019s coverage matches Kennedy\u2019s words.\n17: An Oct. 12 article about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship and corruption in Ukraine said, \"President (Poroshenko), who had favoured Hillary Clinton in the American elections of 2016, was keen to patch things up with Mr.\n18: Trump.\"\n19: The rest of the article does the Republicans no favors, laying out the political work of Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort in Ukraine, and corruption under the previous president.\n20: \"We are a bit puzzled by Sen. Kennedy citing us to the effect that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections,\" the Economist\u2019s U.S. editor John Prideaux told us.\n21: Prideaux said Poroshenko and others trusted Clinton to be tougher on Russia than Trump.\n22: In the campaign, Trump often talked about building closer ties to Russia, and warned at rallies that undoing Russia\u2019s hold on Crimea could trigger World War III.\n23: \"Mr. Poroshenko did not make his feelings secret in Ukraine,\" Prideaux said.\n24: \"But nor did he direct any government agencies to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, which is what Mr. Putin did.\"\n25: More of Kennedy\u2019s sources Kennedy mentioned The Economist three times in his interview, but he also listed other news organizations.\n26: \"It's been well documented in the Financial Times, in Politico, in The Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise,\" he said.\n27: None of those stories put Poroshenko at the heart of a plan to interfere in the U.S. election.\n28: They do paint a picture of leaders fearful of Russia and of Trump\u2019s comments that took a more conciliatory stance on Russian aggression.\n29: The Financial Times focused on Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who revealed over $12 million in secret payments to Manafort from Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russia party.\n30: The Mueller special counsel investigation did not cite those records, but Manafort is now in prison for hiding his foreign income.\n31: Leshchenko told the Financial Times that in addition to exposing corruption, it was important to show that Trump was a \"pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.\u2019\" But Financial Times editor Edward Luce said there was no overlap between Kennedy\u2019s sweeping claims and the newspaper\u2019s coverage.\n32: \"I\u2019ve been racking my brain, as have my colleagues, as to which Financial Times reporting Senator Kennedy\u2019s referring to,\" Luce said Dec. 2 on MSNBC .\n33: In January 2017, Politico covered some of the same ground, but focused more on the work of a Democratic political contractor who tried to dig up dirt on Trump and his advisers.\n34: Republicans frequently mention that article.\n35: We vetted it and found that the GOP has used its findings selectively.\n36: RELATED: The Politico story at the center of a Ukraine conspiracy The article specifically said there was little evidence of a top-down effort in Ukraine.\n37: The Washington Examiner published many opinion and analysis pieces that put Ukrainians\u2019 actions in a dark light, but its straight reporting pieces tracked with the accounts in other publications.",

        "passage": "0: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s flagship proposal to curb prescription drug prices, the \"Lower Drug Costs Now Act\" \u2015 H.R.\n1: 3 \u2015 could come up for a vote in the chamber this month.\n2: The measure would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for a limited number of drugs, cap what seniors pay out-of-pocket at $2,000 and force companies that have raised prices beyond inflation since 2016 to either reverse the price or rebate the amount of the increase to the federal government.\n3: And drug manufacturers are in full attack mode.\n4: Take a recent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America advertising message embedded in the popular, inside-the-Beltway \"Politico Playbook PM\" newsletter.\n5: \"Speaker Pelosi's drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years,\" read the ad.\n6: \"CBO's preliminary estimate found this bill \u2018would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u2019\" The trade group\u2019s statement represents a core drug-industry argument, deployed whenever lawmakers propose reining in drug prices: Efforts to limit what drug companies can charge means they won\u2019t have the means or incentive to develop lifesaving medications.\n7: The argument also appears in ads like this one \u2015 from America\u2019s Biopharmaceutical Companies \u2015 that highlight patients who say they depend on new medications to keep chronic conditions at bay.\n8: But many experts contest the link between drug prices and pharmaceutical R&D.\n9: So PhRMA\u2019s citation of the Congressional Budget Office \u2015 an influential nonpartisan government agency \u2015 caught our attention.\n10: We decided to look deeper.\n11: What the CBO says A PhRMA spokeswoman pointed us to a preliminary CBO analysis of H.R.\n12: 3\n13: Published Oct. 11, the letter doesn\u2019t analyze the Pelosi bill but attempts to explain in broad strokes what kind of economic impact it might have.\n14: The \"$1 trillion\" over 10 years statistic is the CBO\u2019s upper estimate (the range begins at $500 billion) of what the industry might lose in revenue if this bill were enacted.\n15: But the agency leaves wiggle room, noting that this is a \"preliminary\" figure and that the agency hasn\u2019t finished analyzing the full bill yet.\n16: Once it does, the $1 trillion could change.\n17: \"They\u2019re trying to provide some sense of the relative impact on drug development, but I don\u2019t think we have enough data to provide this,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University.\n18: \"It\u2019s not a fact.\n19: It\u2019s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground.\"\n20: That leads to the next issue: If pharmaceutical revenues dip, would fewer innovative drugs become available?\n21: Technically, kind of.\n22: But there\u2019s a lot of important context that PhRMA\u2019s assertion overlooks.\n23: The CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market.\n24: But the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average.\n25: That\u2019s 300 new drugs over 10 years.\n26: So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that\u2019s a loss of 5%.\n27: Certainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction.\n28: But none of the experts we spoke with saw it as a blow to innovation.\n29: \"The lower prices envisioned by [Pelosi\u2019s] bill would barely slow new drug discovery at all,\" argued Dr. Peter Bach, who directs the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an op-ed for Bloomberg .\n30: It\u2019s not clear from the CBO analysis what kind of clinical value these forgone drugs would have \u2015 whether they would represent meaningful breakthroughs or marginal improvements to medications that already exist.\n31: We asked PhRMA.\n32: The organization\u2019s position is that the lost revenue could discourage drugmakers from researching new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s , lung cancer and sickle cell disease .\n33: But the group didn\u2019t offer much evidence explaining how or why this would happen, or acknowledging that it would involve stepping away from potentially lucrative markets.\n34: And experts dispute the idea \u2015 Dusetzina called the industry line \"a scare tactic.\"\n35: In fact, she said, \"there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.\"\n36: This gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn\u2019t actually done by drugmakers.\n37: The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy.\n38: Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation.\n39: And any loss of new drugs would likely be at least somewhat offset by Americans\u2019 increased ability to afford newly cheaper drugs.\n40: As the CBO report put it: \"The overall effect on the health of families in the United States that would stem from increased use of prescription drugs but decreased availability of new drugs is unclear.\"\n41: So, in short: Nonpartisan analysis suggests that H.R.\n42: 3 could result in fewer drugs coming to market.\n43: But it\u2019s a very preliminary estimate, and even then, it suggests only a small dip.\n44: The value of the drugs that don\u2019t emerge is unclear, too.\n45: All this context matters a lot.\n46: \"Hundreds of billions in savings to taxpayers, businesses and patients would mean a real but very small decline in the rate at which new treatments are discovered,\" Bach wrote.\n47: Other arguments PhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers .\n48: It found a much higher impact \u2015 arguing that H.R.3 would result in \"as many as 100 fewer drugs\" entering the American market in the next 10 years.\n49: This White House report comes after President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to work with Congress to lower drug prices.\n50: The CEA number rests on a series of assumptions.\n51: First, it estimates that a new drug costs $2 billion to develop.\n52: It also assumes that drug companies typically spend at least a fifth of their revenue on research and development.\n53: Therefore, if companies\u2019 revenue goes down by $1 trillion, then the math comes out to losing 100 drugs.\n54: But experts called this analysis suspect at best.\n55: For one thing, Bach told us, the $2 billion figure isn\u2019t substantiated.\n56: For another, the CEA assumes that \"every penny of company R&D spending goes to inventing new drugs.\"\n57: That, he added, is \"utter nonsense.\"\n58: Multiple experts noted that the CEA assumes pharmaceutical companies would cut their R&D to perfectly match the proportion of revenue they currently spend.\n59: There\u2019s no reason to assume that\u2019s true.\n60: Drug companies also spend a good deal on marketing, administration and dividends to shareholders.\n61: Dusetzina also noted that the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the increased revenue drug companies might experience from more people being able to afford drugs and therefore buy them.\n62: And it assumes the drugs that never make it to the marketplace would be of high value \u2015 without evidence to support that.\n63: \"This is not a serious analysis of the question of trade-offs of this policy and innovation.\n64: This is fearmongering,\" Dusetzina said.",

        "passage": "0: At a NATO summit in London, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his adversaries back across the pond: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a key figure in the inquiry into impeaching the president.\n1: Trump has repeatedly referred back to the time when Schiff paraphrased Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 an event at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n2: Trump has portrayed Schiff\u2019s words as a fabrication that twisted what he said, but Schiff prefaced his remarks by saying they were not verbatim but were rather \"the essence of what the president communicates\" and \"in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\"\n3: In a press conference at the NATO summit, Trump once again attacked Schiff over his remarks, suggesting that Schiff could be arrested for what he said.\n4: \"This guy (Schiff) is sick,\" Trump said.\n5: \"He made up the conversation.\n6: He lied.\n7: If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail.\n8: He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity.\n9: This is a sick person.\n10: He's a liar.\"\n11: We found it hard to believe that, outside of the walls of Congress, someone who fabricated and lied would be \"thrown in jail.\"\n12: Experts said there is something to what Trump is saying that deserves explanation, but ultimately he\u2019s still wrong that Schiff could be subject to prosecution, even if he wasn\u2019t in Congress.\n13: (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)\n14: The Speech or Debate Clause Trump has a point that members of Congress have special speech protections that members of the general public do not.\n15: The Constitution\u2019s \" Speech or Debate Clause \" says that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other Place.\"\n16: It aligns with the Constitution\u2019s determination that the House, and not another branch of government, should have the power to sanction its own members for abuses.\n17: \"The Speech or Debate Clause protects legislators from all criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits for legislative conduct, broadly understood as anything within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity and necessary to the deliberative process,\" said Howard M. Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University.\n18: \"This includes the sort of legislative oversight and investigation in which Schiff is engaged when discussing that phone call.\"\n19: There are limits.\n20: In the 1979 Supreme Court decision Hutchinson vs. Proxmire , the justices ruled that Sen. William Proxmire was not immune from civil or criminal challenge made in a press release or constituent newsletter.\n21: \"But the clear implication is that the same statements, had they been made on the Senate floor or in a committee hearing, would have been immune,\" Wasserman said.\n22: Can fabrication or libel be punished criminally?\n23: The vast majority of libel or slander cases are civil rather than criminal, said Leonard Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor.\n24: This means the speaker\u2019s money could be at risk if they lose a libel or slander case, but they would not be imprisoned.\n25: However, criminal libel laws of one kind or another do exist on the books in almost half the states.\n26: According to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists , two dozen states have criminal libel laws.\n27: The Supreme Court ruled in the 1964 case Garrison vs. Louisiana that the standard for criminal conviction is the same as in the landmark case from the same year, New York Times vs. Sullivan , that addresses civil libel cases.\n28: \"The prosecution must prove falsity and actual malice, beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Wasserman said.\n29: Some of today\u2019s 24 state laws wouldn\u2019t be relevant to the Schiff example.\n30: The laws in Illinois and Texas only cover slanders against financial institutions, while the one in Massachusetts concerns hate speech based on race or other classifications.\n31: Three others specifically exclude imprisonment as a possible sentence.\n32: (The states that do set maximum prison sentences top out at one year, possibly including fines.)\n33: In addition, the Committee to Protect Journalists cites court cases in seven of these states that would seem to make these laws unconstitutional today, meaning that their existence on the books is archaic.\n34: Even the states that have criminal libel laws rarely use them.\n35: \"As a general proposition, prosecutors have vastly better things to do with their time that pursue charges of criminal libel,\" Niehoff said.\n36: In addition, such laws \"would likely be deemed unconstitutional under the First Amendment if they were applied,\" said Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University\u2019s S.I.\n37: Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n38: Importantly for Schiff\u2019s case, there\u2019s no criminal libel statute for the District of Columbia, or an equivalent federal statute.\n39: Nor is there one in Schiff\u2019s home state of California.\n40: \"So even if Schiff's summaries of the conversations were knowingly false and he were not immune, I am not sure what law he could be prosecuted under,\" Wasserman said.",

        "passage": "0: Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has a new take on how red-flag gun laws work.\n1: Generally speaking, the laws allow judges to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n2: Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature have been widely divided on a bill that would create such a law in Wisconsin.\n3: Gov.\n4: Tony Evers, a Democrat, called the Legislature into special session to consider a red-flag law proposal and a separate measure expanding background checks to cover all gun sales, but the GOP quickly adjourned the session without taking action on either.\n5: In a Nov. 10, 2019 appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront , Vos told host Adrienne Pedersen: \"What (Democrats) wanted to do was say, \u2018I think you might do something so I\u2019m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019 \" In other words, the claim is the proposed law would allow a gun to be taken away, and then put the burden of proof on the gun owner to show they are not a threat in order to get the gun back.\n6: But that\u2019s counter to one of the basic foundations of the U.S. legal system.\n7: It would be akin to saying someone charged with a crime has to prove their innocence -- not that a prosecutor has to convince a judge or jury of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\n8: Is Vos right?\n9: Let\u2019s dig in.\n10: Defense misses the mark Asked for backup, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the language of the proposed bill that says once an injunction is issued, a judge can vacate it \"if the respondent demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is no longer substantially likely to injure the respondent or another person if the respondent possesses a firearm.\"\n11: The language is accurate, but Vos is misapplying it.\n12: He argues this standard applies to the process from the beginning, when the language actually refers to a step later in the process, when a gun owner can ask the judge to reconsider the original decision.\n13: Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University, said the burden of proof is always with the petitioner when it comes to seeking red-flag seizures.\n14: \"What that burden is -- \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 or \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 -- varies state by state and depending on whether it\u2019s a temporary ex parte order or a final order,\" Blocher told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n15: \"But in all cases, a judge has to be persuaded of the risk.\"\n16: Indeed, the proposal from Evers would allow guns to be seized if a judge finds \"reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely\" to harm themselves or others.\n17: How would it work?\n18: The process varies a bit state-to-state, but always begins with a petition to a court that argues an individual is a danger to himself (or herself) or others.\n19: Such a petition typically comes from law enforcement officials, but may also come from family members or friends.\n20: Under Evers\u2019 proposal, a judge or court commissioner would hear the request and then decide whether to issue a preliminary order without first having to notify or hear from the gun owner.\n21: A temporary order is then put in place for up to 14 days.\n22: So, there would be a short period where a gun could be taken before an owner has a say, but with the burden placed on the other party.\n23: A judge would then schedule a second hearing to make a final determination.\n24: The gun owner would have a chance to be present for this hearing.\n25: This is where whomever filed the original petition would make their case.\n26: The burden would be on them to convince the judge the gun owner was a danger.\n27: The final order would be valid for up to one year, though requests could be made to extend it.\n28: Additionally, the gun owner could ask the court for an early end to the order This is the step the language Vos cited actually refers to.\n29: It is then -- when a gun owner is seeking an early end to an order -- that the burden of proof would fall on the gun owner.\n30: Laws are relatively new The first red-flag law was put in place in Connecticut in 1990, but it wasn\u2019t until 2005 that the second law was approved in Indiana.\n31: Following the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many other states passed similar laws.\n32: Now, at least 17 states and Washington D.C. have a red-flag law in place.\n33: Each state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, while 12 states also allow family or household members to do so.\n34: A handful of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, colleagues or school officials, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , a research and gun control advocacy organization.\n35: There are already several spots in Wisconsin law that relate to when guns can be taken.\n36: Under current law, a person is prohibited from having guns or must surrender their firearms if they\u2019re \"subject to a domestic abuse injunction, a child abuse injunction, or, in certain cases, a harassment or an individuals-at-risk injunction.\"\n37: If the person surrenders a firearm because of one of those convictions, the firearm can\u2019t be returned to them until a court determines that the injunction has been vacated or has expired, according to a November 2019 analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau .\n38: The law also says people must surrender their firearms as a result of certain proceedings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: Is West Virginia falling significantly behind in the job skills required for today\u2019s economy?\n1: West Virginia University President E. Gordon Gee said so in an address to students at Musselman High School in Berkeley County.\n2: \"In West Virginia, we have 20,000 jobs in which we don\u2019t have skilled workers,\" Gee told students at the high school .\n3: Gee\u2019s office told PolitiFact West Virginia that they could not point to the original source of the statistic.\n4: However, we were able to reverse-engineer data that falls short of Gee\u2019s number.\n5: This gets a bit complicated, so bear with us.\n6: Here\u2019s the overall concept.\n7: First, we\u2019ll estimate the total number of job openings in West Virginia that require skilled workers.\n8: Then we\u2019ll look into how hard these jobs are to fill, based on the educational shortcomings of West Virginia\u2019s workforce.\n9: How many job openings in West Virginia require advanced skills?\n10: On the job openings side, Brian Lego, a research assistant professor at WVU\u2019s College of Business and Economics, suggested we look at data produced on an experimental basis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s chief agency for employment statistics.\n11: This data in question is a spinoff of the longstanding Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey , which produces monthly estimates of job openings, hires, and employee departures on a national basis.\n12: For several years, the bureau has also produced an experimental study of this data on a state-by-state basis, which is what Lego was referring to.\n13: We looked at the most recent data for West Virginia, which covers the first six months of 2019.\n14: We found that in each of those six months, West Virginia had 38,000 job openings.\n15: (BLS acknowledges that this is an estimate, though the agency says it isn\u2019t sure what the margin of error is.)\n16: This 38,000 figure represents all job openings in West Virginia -- not necessarily those requiring advanced skills.\n17: However, we found a way to estimate the percentage requiring advanced skills, using data in a report published by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce .\n18: The report is from 2010, but it offered projections for the share of jobs in every state by 2018 that would require various levels of educational attainment, so it should offer a rough guide.\n19: For West Virginia, the report said, 9% of jobs would be open to high school dropouts, 38% would require a high school degree, 12% would require some college but not a college degree, 15% would require an associate\u2019s degree, 17% would require a bachelor\u2019s degree, and 8% would require a master\u2019s degree or higher.\n20: All told, the Georgetown data sees 25% of jobs requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\n21: And 25% of 38,000 job openings in West Virginia works out to 9,500 job openings in any given month that require a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n22: How big are the educational shortcomings in West Virginia\u2019s workforce?\n23: This 9,500 figure refers to the number of high-skill job openings in West Virginia -- the demand side.\n24: What about the supply side -- the share of West Virginia workers who have the necessary skills to fill those jobs?\n25: We found a way to estimate that number, too.\n26: Statistics from the U.S. Education Department show that in 2016, about 21% of West Virginians age 25 and up had a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n27: Meanwhile, in October 2019, West Virginia had 38,052 unemployed workers .\n28: If one assumes that this group of unemployed workers is a representative cross-section of the state\u2019s educational attainment patterns, this would mean there are just under 8,000 unemployed West Virginians who could fill a job requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n29: But in reality, better-educated workers tend to be more likely to be employed, meaning the actual number of unemployed workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree is probably well below 8,000.\n30: Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact West Virginia that a reasonable guess is probably 4,000.\n31: So of the 9,500 West Virginia job openings requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree, qualified workers who are currently unemployed could potentially fill a 4,000 of those.\n32: That leaves 4,500 bachelor\u2019s-level jobs unfilled.\n33: And that\u2019s quite a bit smaller than Gee\u2019s 20,000 figure.\n34: Some caveats We should emphasize that our estimates involve a lot of moving parts, each with a source of statistical error.\n35: We also focused on bachelor\u2019s-level jobs.\n36: If we were to instead define \"skilled\" positions as requiring at least some college experience, the supply of skilled jobs could go as high as 53%, according to the Georgetown University data.\n37: That works out to 21,400 jobs requiring advanced skills, rather than 9,500.\n38: Using this broader number could make Gee\u2019s figures closer to accurate.\n39: Finally, we should note that in the Georgetown comparison, West Virginia ranks 51st in the nation -- dead last among the 50 states and the District of Columbia -- in the percentage of jobs requiring advanced skills.\n40: So West Virginia may require advanced skills to fill many of its jobs, but the pressure to fill these advanced-skill jobs is weaker in West Virginia than it is in every other state.\n41: \"Gee's argument could have been better supported by focusing on the deficit of college educated workers in West Virginia compared to the rest of the U.S. -- 21% versus 31%,\" Sinclair said.\n42: \"That seems to be a really big problem.\n43: That might actually be the driver of West Virginia\u2019s ranking in terms of jobs requiring college degrees: Employers go where the workers are.\"",

                "Gordon Gee, the president of West Virginia University, made the claim that in West Virginia, there are 20,000 jobs for which there aren't skilled workers[2].",
                "However, a reverse-engineered data contradicts this number[4].",
                "Collecting empirical data over six months indicated that the state of West Virginia had roughly 38,000 job openings[14].",
                "Academic qualifications requirement for these jobs varied, with 25% or 9,500 of those needing a bachelor\u2019s degree[21], in hopes of obtaining a larger pool of talents with higher education levels.",
                "However, considering the previous report from 2010 which predicted job shares by 2018[18], and the unemployment rate in October 2019 which counted 38,052 unemployed workers[27], it raises uncertainties over Gee's claim.",
                "Considering that better-educated workers are often more likely to be employed[29], it suggests that the actual number of unemployed degree-holders is probably significantly less than 8,000.",
                "Hence, of the 9,500 job openings that require a bachelor's degree, only 4,000 could potentially be filled by currently unemployed qualified workers [31].",

                "Therefore, while there is a labor skill gap in West Virginia, the extent of this issue appears less severe than indicated by Gee's initial approximation."

Foundation\u2019s charitable giving.\n9: In 2015, we fact-checked a similar statement from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.\n10: \"Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits,\" he said during his show.\n11: \"Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.\"\n12: We rated that claim Mostly False .\n13: In 2016, we rated a similar claim False from Reince Priebus.\n14: This case is similarly inaccurate.\n15: How the Clinton Foundation works The Facebook post\u2019s claim is built on the assumption that the primary charitable contributions made by the Clinton Foundation are grants.\n16: But that\u2019s not the case.\n17: Instead of giving all of its money away, the philanthropy keeps its money in-house and hires people to carry out its own humanitarian programs.\n18: That means the Clinton Foundation\u2019s finances get complicated.\n19: \"Although it has \u2018foundation\u2019 in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,\" wrote Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University\u2019s Fisher College of Business, in the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 2015.\n20: \"In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment.\"\n21: What kinds of projects does the foundation work on?\n22: The Clinton Development Initiative has helped farmers in Malawi grow and sell more crops and assisted coffee farmers in Haiti .\n23: The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership has helped to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia.\n24: \"While measuring charitable endeavors by the amount of grants awarded may be appropriate for many private foundations, it is not for an organization that acts as a direct service provider like the Clinton Foundation,\" Mittendorf wrote.\n25: Where the foundation\u2019s money goes The Facebook post took the Clinton Foundation\u2019s tax filings out of context to paint an inaccurate picture of how it spends its money.\n26: We looked at both the Clinton Foundation\u2019s 990 tax form and audited financials from 2014.\n27: Mittendorf said the latter is a more complete measure of the organization\u2019s finances, as it includes all entities related to the foundation, such as the Clinton Health Access Initiative.\n28: Upon first inspection, the numbers in the 990 form look like they affirm the Facebook post.\n29: But there\u2019s more to these figures than meets the eye.\n30: RELATED: No, Russia did not donate $145 million to the Clinton Foundation First, $177 million is the total revenue for the Clinton Foundation \u2014 which includes money from program services and investments, not just donations, as the Facebook post claims.\n31: And the group\u2019s 2014 audited financial report puts the group and its related affiliates\u2019 revenue closer to $242 million.\n32: Second, the post inflated the importance of the $5 million the Clinton Foundation spent on grants.\n33: Since most of the foundation\u2019s work is done in-house, all of its charitable expenses aren\u2019t classified as grants on tax forms.\n34: Charity Navigator, a nonprofit organization that evaluates charities, reported that 86.6% of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s expenses go toward program expenses.\n35: The foundation\u2019s audited financials show that it spent $217 million on programs in 2014.\n36: And 10.7% of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s money goes toward administrative expenses, according to Charity Navigator.\n37: That proportion actually distinguishes the foundation from most other organizations.\n38: Third, the Clinton Foundation did not spend $85 million \"for their salaries and travel,\" as the Facebook post claims.\n39: The foundation\u2019s audited financials show that it spent about $20 million on travel and $95 million on salaries and benefits in 2014.\n40: But not all the money allocated for salaries and travel in 2014 went to the group\u2019s employees \u2014\u00a0the bulk of it went to program services.\n41: About $13 million fell under the \"management/general\" category.\n42: The Clintons themselves did not receive compensation from the foundation in 2014, according to the foundation\u2019s 990 form.",

        "passage": "0: In Gov.\n1: Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 10th State of the State address last week, he claimed that under his administration, \"We have the lowest corporate tax rate since 1968.\"\n2: New York\u2019s business climate has for years been the subject of criticism from business groups and conservative lawmakers, so we wondered about this claim.\n3: We approached Cuomo\u2019s office, where spokesman Jason Conwall provided us with historical tax data.\n4: The Department of Taxation and Finance maintains this data, and a table titled \"History of Corporate Tax Rates in New York State, 1917-2009,\" shows that between 1968 and 1970, the corporate tax rate, also known as the corporation franchise tax, was 7 percent.\n5: The rate did not fall below 7 percent in later years, and in the final year, 2009, the rate was 7.1 percent.\n6: Since 2009, the rate changed once, when it was lowered to 6.5 percent, Conwall said.\n7: The 6.5 percent rate took effect on Jan. 1, 2016 .\n8: Historically, New York has had separate rates for banks and insurance companies.\n9: The bank tax was merged into the corporate tax system in 2015.\n10: We reached out to observers of the state\u2019s tax policies for context and to check for any conflicting data.\n11: The Tax Foundation, a national organization, studies federal and state tax policy and advocated for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act supported by President Trump and congressional Republicans.\n12: The Tax Foundation confirmed Cuomo\u2019s claim.\n13: \"New York saw remarkable improvement in both its corporate rate - bringing it down to 6.5 percent - and structure - cutting four corporate bases down to three - through tax reform in 2014,\" said policy analyst Janelle Cammenga.\n14: The Tax Foundation advocates for simpler tax codes, and Cammenga noted that New York\u2019s complex individual income tax code affects so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships, sole-proprietorships, and limited liability companies.\n15: E.J.\n16: McMahon, founder and research director at the conservative Empire Center, also confirmed Cuomo\u2019s claim.\n17: McMahon added that in the 12-county region in downstate New York served by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, a surcharge brings the tax rate to 8.34 percent there.\n18: But even with the surcharge, it\u2019s still the lowest rate since 1970, McMahon said.\n19: At the left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, executive director Ron Deutsch confirmed Cuomo\u2019s claim.\n20: Dave Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan research and advocacy organization in Albany and New York City, said that readers should be aware that companies in New York pay more than just the corporate franchise tax.\n21: In addition to the MTA\u00a0surcharge, set by the state , New York City imposes a 8.85 percent corporate franchise tax.\n22: \"Overall, it\u2019s good that New York State\u2019s corporate franchise tax rates are lower than they were and are competitive nationwide , but it\u2019s just a small part of the taxes paid by businesses in New York,\" Friedfel said.",

Mark Pocan , D-Madison, says Wisconsinites should lay the blame at the feet of President Donald Trump.\n4: In a Dec. 2, 2019, tweet , Pocan said Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers \u2014 forcing more than\u00a01600 dairy farms to close.\"\n5: Trade tensions are certainly having an impact, but is it reasonable to blame them \u2014 and Trump \u2014 for that many closures?\n6: Dairy was in trouble long before Trump Pocan\u2019s is roughly correct on the number of closures.\n7: Wisconsin had 9,288 dairy farms on Feb. 1, 2017 \u2014 about two weeks after Trump was sworn in.\n8: By Dec. 1, 2019, that number dropped to 7,337, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .\n9: That\u2019s a loss of 1,951 farms, even more than Pocan referenced.\n10: But Wisconsin dairy farms closing is hardly a new trend.\n11: The number of milking operations here has plummeted by more than half in the last 15 years, from 15,000 at the end of 2004 to about 7,300 as of December 2019.\n12: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That trend has indeed worsened under Trump, however.\n13: In the 34 months since Trump\u2019s election Wisconsin has lost an average of 57 dairy farms per month.\n14: In the 34 months before that, the monthly average was 33 farms.\n15: Many factors conspire against farmers Pocan blamed the closures not only on Trump, but specifically on the president\u2019s trade wars.\n16: Defending the claim, Pocan spokesman Usamah Andrabi pointed to a category of Chinese dairy exports that dropped from mid-2018 to mid-2019 amid retaliatory tariffs.\n17: \"That being said, I think we can reasonably attribute the majority of these farm closures to the effects of China\u2019s tariffs/Trump\u2019s trade war,\" Andrabi said.\n18: That\u2019s simply not accurate.\n19: Pocan\u2019s claim \u2014 and his spokesman\u2019s defense \u2014 oversimplify an industry facing a complex set of economic pressures.\n20: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Low milk prices, historic levels of oversupply and changing consumer demand were dealing devastating blows to dairy farmers long before Trump picked a fight with China.\n21: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel summarized the demand struggles this way as part of its Dairyland in Distress project, an exhaustive examination of the state\u2019s trademark industry.\n22: Sales of milk as a beverage have fallen steadily since the 1970s, with fewer parents encouraging their children to drink milk than ever before.\n23: Soy milk and almond milk \u2014 which dairy farmers point out aren't real milk \u2014 and scores of sports drinks have flooded the beverage market.\n24: And although consumption of cheese, yogurt and butter have all increased, they've not always kept pace with runaway production.\n25: Today, for instance, U.S. commercial and government cheese stockpiles are at about 1 billion pounds \u2014 the highest level in a century.\n26: At the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have shrunk in response to tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum.\n27: Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65 percent, according to industry figures, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10 percent.\n28: So tariffs are a factor in limiting demand, but far from the only one.\n29: And supply is a major problem as well.\n30: Advances in genetics and feed science mean the average cow today produces about four times more milk than it would have in the 1950s.\n31: This leads to a market saturation that both generates waste \u2014 some farmers are forced to dump milk down the drain for lack of a buyer \u2014 and contributes to reduced prices.\n32: Milk prices have nudged up in recent months but before that went through a yearslong downturn that often left prices below the break-even point for farms.\n33: \"There were four years of the depressed milk prices before the trade war started,\" Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition, told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n34: \"If you go back and you look, we've always had attrition going on.\"",

        "passage": "0: Attorney General William Barr blasted the FBI over its 2016 decision to open the Russia investigation later led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , rejecting an inspector general\u2019s conclusion that the FBI\u2019s probe was justified from the get-go.\n1: \"The Inspector General\u2019s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\" Barr said in a statement .\n2: The report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz did find \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" left out of the FBI\u2019s applications for court-ordered surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n3: But it said the agency\u2019s decision to open an investigation into the campaign\u2019s ties with Russia was warranted and not motivated by politics.\n4: Barr\u2019s reading put him at odds with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who pledged to make changes to the FBI\u2019s surveillance process and accepted the report\u2019s determinations in full.\n5: Barr doubled down in interviews with NBC News and the Wall Street Journal , calling the basis for the investigation \"flimsy\" and claiming the FBI spied on the Trump campaign.\n6: He said John Durham, the U.S. attorney he picked to lead a separate probe on the same topic, would have the final word on the matter.\n7: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to look at some key conclusions from the IG report, which was based on more than 1 million documents and interviews with over 100 witnesses, in light of Barr\u2019s remarks.\n8: (A Justice Department spokesperson referred us to the report and Barr\u2019s interviews.)\n9: We found that Barr\u2019s claim that the report shows the FBI launched its probe on \"the thinnest of suspicions\" does not square with one of the report\u2019s key findings.\n10: The FBI had \"authorized purpose\" When the FBI opened its investigation \u2014 known as \"Crossfire Hurricane\" \u2014 into possible coordination between members of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, it had both an \"authorized purpose\" and an \"articulable factual basis,\" the IG report found .\n11: The investigation was launched on July 31, 2016, three days after the FBI heard from a \"friendly foreign government\" that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had signaled that Russia had dirt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Trump campaign.\n12: The IG report said this information alone was enough to trigger the Russia probe, because it gave the FBI reason to believe a crime or threat to U.S. national security was in the works.\n13: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The report also discounted the role of a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, saying it \"played no role\" in the FBI\u2019s decision.\n14: (Trump has falsely claimed the dossier started the investigation.)\n15: Rosa Brooks, professor of law and policy at Georgetown University, told us that Barr\u2019s assessment that the suspicions were thin \"appears willfully inaccurate.\"\n16: \"The report concluded precisely the opposite,\" she said.\n17: \"The IG report makes it clear that the decision to launch the investigation was justified.\"\n18: Jennifer Daskal, professor of law at American University, agreed.\n19: \"Barr\u2019s statement is at best a misleading statement, if not a deliberate distortion, of what the report actually found,\" she said.\n20: The investigation was not politically motivated The IG report also dismissed the notion that the investigation was politically motivated.\n21: For years, Trump has ripped into former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page for anti-Trump texts that he saw as proof that career government officials were out to get him.\n22: But the report concluded that Page and Strzok were not the decision makers Trump made them out to be.\n23: According to the report , Lisa Page \"did not play a role in the decision\" to open the investigation or the related individual cases tied to Papadopoulos, Carter Page and fellow Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n24: Strzok was \"directly involved,\" but \"he was not the sole, or even the highest-level, decision maker as to any of those matters,\" the report found.\n25: The final say on whether to launch the investigation belonged to Bill Priestap, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, who complied with DOJ and FBI policies and made the decision with widespread support from FBI officials.\n26: \"We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced his decision,\" the IG report said .\n27: The FBI\u2019s applications to surveil Carter Page left out information Where Barr has a point is on the issue of intrusiveness.\n28: To determine which campaign officials had Russian connections, the FBI used various methods listed among its \"least intrusive\" measures, such as open-source searches, the report said .\n29: That led the agency to open four individual cases against Page, Papadopoulos, Manafort and Flynn.\n30: The FBI then used confidential human sources \u2014 a \"permitted\" but more intrusive technique \u2014 to \"interact and consensually record conversations\" with Papadopoulous and Page.\n31: The IG report found no evidence that this technique was politically motivated or done in bad faith.\n32: Eventually, the FBI secured and repeatedly renewed a court-ordered FISA warrant to electronically surveil Page.\n33: The IG report said this technique is considered \"highly intrusive\" and said the FBI did not seek similar warrants to monitor Papadopoulous, Manafort or Flynn.\n34: Notably, there were problems with the requests to surveil Page, which relied in large part on information from Steele.\n35: The report counted seven \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in the original application and 10 \"additional significant errors\" in the three renewal requests, including one resulting from alleged document tampering by a low-level FBI lawyer.\n36: The IG report said these errors made the FISA applications appear more convincing.\n37: The report was silent on whether the court would have approved them with more accurate information.\n38: Still, surveillance under FISA is legal, and the report said the FBI did not \"infiltrate\" or otherwise spy on the Trump campaign.\n39: Plus, the errors made in relation to the FISA application process had no bearing on the start of the Russia investigation.\n40: \"The report separately found some problems with respect to specific, and later in time, applications for FISA surveillance of Carter Page,\" Daskal told us.\n41: But those problems \"do not change the fact that the initial overarching decision to investigate was justified.\"",

Bob Rita of Blue Island introduced a city-backed plan to lower both state and city tax rates for Chicago\u2019s casino, which is likely to become the state\u2019s highest grossing.\n12: The gambling bill that passed the General Assembly in the spring and was later signed into law by Democratic Gov.\n13: J.B. Pritzker calls for a 33.3% tax on the casino\u2019s gross receipts dedicated to the city\u2019s pension obligations.\n14: Rita\u2019s legislation would have eliminated the city\u2019s flat tax and replaced it with rates ranging from 10.5% to 34.7%.\n15: \"It would be a cut to the city, because you\u2019re eliminating that 33% [flat rate],\" Rita told us in a phone interview.\n16: Meanwhile, the state\u2019s original graduated rates of 15% to 50% on the casino would have been lowered to a range of 12% to 40%, according to the bill.\n17: The varying rates would be applied at different levels based on how much money the casino brings in under the plan.\n18: A similar series of graduated rates for both Chicago and the state would apply to revenue from table games.\n19: When we ran the bill\u2019s specifics by Syverson, he agreed the legislative language would cut rather than raise Chicago\u2019s take.\n20: \"If, in fact, we use the strict definition of the bill and Chicago was only going to get the tax rates that you gave me \u2026 then I would concede that Chicago would get a little bit less money,\" he said.\n21: \"Now, having said that, anyone with any common sense would say, why would Chicago introduce a bill that says, \u2018We want less money\u2019?\"\n22: Rita\u2019s rejoinder: Without a lower tax structure that encourages companies to build and run a Chicago casino, there won\u2019t be a casino for the city or the state to tax.\n23: Still, Syverson remains concerned about the plan.\n24: He said his job as a state senator is to ensure Illinois doesn\u2019t lose out on needed funding from a Chicago casino and noted Lightfoot and the Chicago City Council have other tools to further tax the casino without getting an OK from the legislature.",

        "passage": "0: As catastrophic bushfires spread across parts of Australia, misinformation about one of the region\u2019s most beloved animals, the koala, spreads, too.\n1: Areas of Australia started to burn in September 2019, marking an early start to the region\u2019s fire season and scorching more than 5 million acres in News South Wales and parts of Queensland.\n2: When the fires became international news, online stories \u2013 like this one \u2013 went viral with shocking headlines that claim koalas are now \"functionally extinct\" as a result of the blaze.\n3: It is true that several hundred koalas have died in the bushfires ( some estimates put the death toll in the thousands) and large swaths of the marsupial\u2019s habitat have been destroyed.\n4: However, the claim that koalas are \"functionally extinct\" is inaccurate.\n5: The story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n7: It appears that the idea that koalas are \"functionally extinct\" started when the Australian Koala Foundation , a local conservation nonprofit that advocates for koala protection and preservation, released a statement in May 2019 calling on Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to enact the Koala Protection Act, which was written in 2016.\n8: \"The Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) believes Koalas may be functionally extinct in the entire landscape of Australia,\" the statement says.\n9: \"The AKF thinks there are no more than 80,000 Koalas in Australia.\"\n10: Since the fires, the organization released another statement in October 2019 standing by its use of the term.\n11: Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the US-based Center for Biological Diversity , told PolitiFact there are two different definitions of \"functionally extinct.\"\n12: One is that a species still occurs in the wild but can\u2019t effectively reproduce, so is all but extinct.\n13: The other, is that a species is so reduced that it can no longer play its role in the ecosystem.\n14: Neither definition, he says, applies to the koala.\n15: The koala population is indeed declining, but AKF\u2019s estimate is much lower than other assessments.\n16: The International Union for Conservation (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of all species, approximates that 300,000 mature adult koalas remain in the wild, and lists the species as vulnerable , a step above endangered and two above critically endangered.\n17: But IUCN last assessed the koala population in 2014, and the species may very well be worse off due to food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought and fires over the last several years.\n18: That said, another group of scholars studied the koala population in 2016 and found comparable numbers.\n19: Nevertheless, several wildlife experts reject the notion that koalas are currently \"functionally extinct.\"\n20: \"By either definition, it's hard to see koalas as functionally extinct,\" Greenwald said.\n21: \"The last estimate for their numbers is roughly 300,000, and in some places they are very much playing their ecological role of munching on eucalyptus leaves.\"\n22: Wildlife conservation experts also told National Geographic that it\u2019s difficult to measure koala populations, even at the best of times, because the animal has a wide range across eastern Australia, are human-shy and live very high up in trees.\n23: Christine Adams-Hosking, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Queensland in Australia, told PolitiFact that koalas \"are certainly not functionally extinct\" in Australia.\n24: And though they have been affected by habitat loss as a result of the fires, she said, it\u2019s too early to know the impact.\n25: \"We will never know exact numbers because we don\u2019t know how many koalas exactly there were there in the first place,\" she said.\n26: \"Time will tell.\n27: Over the next few years, the burnt areas will need to be monitored to see how many koalas recolonize the burnt areas and whether they can successfully build up their population numbers again.\"\n28: PolitiFact also reached out to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia about the claim.\n29: The organization\u2019s senior manager for land clearing and restoration, Stuart Blanch, told us that while the bushfires are a setback for koala conservation, WWF-Australia does not agree that the species is functionally extinct.\n30: The organization estimates that from July to November, the fires scorched more than 8% of the known koala forest in New South Wales and that, even before the fires, koala populations disappeared from large areas of eastern and southern Australia.\n31: \"While koalas will survive this bushfire crisis, the longer-term picture in New South Wales and Queensland is not good unless excessive tree clearing is halted,\" Blanch said.\n32: \"WWF-Australia has published a report projecting \u2018that koalas will become extinct in the wild in eastern Australia by as early as 2050 \u2013 and highly likely by 2100 \u2013 if deforestation and other threats continue.\u2019 \" The organization said that koalas require remaining eucalypt forests to be preserved, cleared forest areas to be regenerated, and isolated patches of habitat to be connected by newly planted wildlife corridors.",

        "passage": "0: West Virginia Gov.\n1: Jim Justice, facing a competitive Republican primary in 2020, recently introduced an ad touting his accomplishments in office, including a focus on K-12 education.\n2: The ad, released in a Dec. 4 tweet , features several West Virginians reading off a series of scripted accomplishments from Justice\u2019s tenure.\n3: One of the accomplishments, voiced by a teacher, is that \"Jim Justice is the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators.\"\n4: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This struck us as odd, since governors of all parties regularly tout their support for teachers \u2014 a group that\u2019s popular with voters and, in many states, a politically powerful constituency.\n5: Teacher salaries have been an especially sensitive issue in West Virginia.\n6: Between 2005 and 2017, West Virginia teacher salaries never rose higher than 44th in the nation.\n7: That history set the stage for a 2018 teacher strike in West Virginia, which was the state\u2019s first major K-12 walkout in almost three decades.\n8: Justice eventually signed a 5% pay bump, which is more than the legislature had offered prior to the strike.\n9: So is Justice really the first West Virginia governor ever to push for teacher pay raises?\n10: His office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we found that each of Justice\u2019s five immediate predecessors either proposed or enacted teacher pay raises.\n11: Gov.\n12: Earl Ray Tomblin, Democrat, 2011-2017 In his first state of the state address in 2011, Tomblin proposed a one-time, across-the-board $800 increase for teachers.\n13: \"Frankly, it should be more and we need to strive for a day when our teachers are paid at a rate equivalent to the most important role they play,\" he said in the speech, according to the Associated Press .\n14: In 2014, despite offering few increases in his relatively austere budget proposal, Tomblin did include a 2% pay raise for teachers.\n15: The bill he eventually signed contained a $1,000 raise for teachers for the 2014-2015 school year.\n16: Gov.\n17: Joe Manchin, Democrat, 2005-2010 As governor, Manchin \u2014 now a U.S.\n18: Senator \u2014 periodically sparred with teachers\u2019 unions over the size of his salary increase proposals.\n19: But both Manchin\u2019s Senate office and West Virginia teachers\u2019 unions agree that he proposed a teacher salary increase and signed it into law .\n20: During his tenure, Manchin raised teacher salaries by 3.5%, according to a joint statement released by the West Virginia Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, and the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association when the groups endorsed Manchin\u2019s Senate reelection bid in 2018.\n21: Manchin\u2019s Senate office cited the same 3.5% increase when we inquired.\n22: The legislation Manchin signed also improved teachers\u2019 annual salary increments and allowed educators to move from a 401(k)-style defined contribution plans to a defined-benefit system.\n23: Gov.\n24: Bob Wise, Democrat, 2001-2005 In his 2001 state of the state address, Wise proposed raising teacher salaries by $1,000, plus $2,500 in incentives.\n25: \"Teachers are the heart of the educational system.\n26: We must honor the work of our teachers,\" he said .\n27: After leaving the governor\u2019s office, Wise became CEO of the Alliance for Excellent Education, an education advocacy group.\n28: Gov.\n29: Cecil Underwood, Republican, 1997-2001 In his 1998 state of the state address, Underwood proposed giving teachers a $750 pay raise.\n30: He signed a three-year pay raise into law later that year.\n31: Gov.\n32: Gaston Caperton, Democrat, 1989-1997 Caperton was governor during a divisive, 11-day West Virginia teacher strike in 1990, but he ended up presiding over a significant pay increase for the state\u2019s teachers.\n33: The strike was settled when all parties agreed on a $5,000 pay increase phased in over three years.\n34: Last year, PolitiFact reported that most significant recent improvement in West Virginia teacher pay compared to other states came between 1990 and 2000, a period during which Caperton and Underwood were in office.\n35: Like Wise, Caperton headed an education group \u2014 the College Board \u2014 after serving as governor.",

        "claim": "\"  justices of the peace in Texas are being asked to choose: \"\"give up your career or violate your religious beliefs\"\" and perform same-sex marriages.\"",
        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: During an interview on a Fort Worth radio program with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, host Chris Salcedo pressed his guest about the case of a Waco justice of the peace who was sanctioned by a state commission earlier this month for only officiating opposite sex, but not same-sex, marriages.\n1: The State Commission on Judicial Conduct issued Justice of the Peace Dianne Hensley a public warning over her refusal to perform same-sex ceremonies; the commission could take further action if she refuses to stop the practice.\n2: Paxton, a Republican, reiterated the stance of his office, one that has not changed since just after the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.\n3: He said people are entitled to religious exemptions when it would violate their faith to carry out the duties of their job.\n4: On the show, Salcedo characterized the case as such: \"I shouldn\u2019t have to give up my career \u2014 make a choice, either give up your career or violate your religious beliefs,\" Salcedo said.\n5: \"The government shouldn\u2019t put me in that position.\"\n6: Saledo\u2019s description of Hensely\u2019s situation is inaccurate.\n7: No one is asking Hensley to violate her religious beliefs to keep her career: officiating marriages is an optional activity.\n8: A state commission\u2019s opinion on the matter suggested she could officiate all or no marriages, but not selectively choose one type.\n9: Protection of religious beliefs Justices of the peace handle low-level civil and criminal cases, including traffic and other Class C misdemeanor cases and civil cases involving up to $10,000.\n10: They can also officiate marriages, but this is considered \"extra-judicial,\" an optional activity that earns them thousands per year in personal income.\n11: So while there may be some financial incentive to do it, it is by no means required.\n12: In fact, some justices of the peace in Texas have chosen not to officiate any marriages in order to avoid the religious dilemma, including in McLennan County, where Hensley hails.\n13: The commission decided to investigate Hensley based at least in part on a Waco Herald-Tribune article in which she was quoted about her decision to decline same-sex marriages and how she believed she was entitled to a religious accommodation.\n14: It found that she had refused to perform same-sex marriages since 2016, instead only performing opposite-sex marriages and referring same-sex couples to other officiating JPs and clergy.\n15: The state commission that sanctioned Hensley said her actions cast \"doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person\u2019s sexual orientation.\"\n16: Now, Hensley can appeal the sanction, start performing same-sex marriages or stop performing marriages altogether.\n17: Hensley has argued that she is entitled to a \"religious exemption,\" but there is no law or legal precedent in Texas establishing such an exemption for a justice of the peace in this context.\n18: This question varies by state, depending on whether the state\u2019s Supreme Court has taken up a case and established a precedent.\n19: In separate interviews, Douglas Laycock and John Dzienkowski, law professors at the University of Texas, said they weren\u2019t aware of any such cases in Texas.\n20: Two legal opinions on the subject that have been issued by state agencies \u2014 a 2015 opinion from the attorney general\u2019s office and the Judicial Commission sanction \u2014 are nonbinding.\n21: In a 2015 opinion filed after the U.S. Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage, Paxton supported people\u2019s right to assert a religious exemption under the First Amendment, though he noted that fines and litigation were possible.\n22: The recent Judicial Commission opinion punished Henlsey for giving off the appearance of bias, seeming to indicate an exemption would not be possible.\n23: But Laycock said neither document is legally binding.\n24: \"The basic answer is we don\u2019t know yet,\" Laycock said.\n25: \"This may well wind up in the courts.\"\n26: Some states, such as North Carolina, have passed laws on this subject, but Texas has not.\n27: The North Carolina law allows some officials, similar to a justice of the peace, to decline to administer any marriages if they have a \"sincerely held religious objection\" to same-sex marriage, but they may not be selective and only marry opposite-sex couples.\n28: Other positions have different requirements People in other government positions, like county clerks who issue marriage licenses, have less flexibility, as issuing marriage licenses can be part of their job description.\n29: Perhaps most famously, Kim Davis , a clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue a license to a same-sex couple and, in a high-profile case, she was sued.\n30: When she refused to comply with the judge\u2019s order compelling her to follow the law, she was jailed for six days for being in contempt of court.\n31: Davis was later released after agreeing not to interfere with other clerks in the office issuing licenses.\n32: Some county clerks in Texas are allowing those officials who object to same-sex marriage to find another clerk within the office to issue a license in their place.\n33: But if everyone else in the office also refuses, the office as a whole can\u2019t deny a couple the right to marry in defiance of the law, Laycock said.\n34: That may explain why no religious exemption case has risen to the Supreme Court level in Texas, Laycock said.\n35: As long as the couple receives their license or has their marriage officiated, the damages they can claim in court are limited to emotional distress.\n36: That someone in Hensley\u2019s position should not be forced to choose between their job and religious belief, as Salcedo commented, is \"not a settled rule of law yet; it\u2019s an opinion about what the law ought to be,\" Laycock said.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: Fox News host Tucker Carlson ripped into immigrants in the nation\u2019s capital, accusing them without evidence of contaminating the Potomac River.\n1: In an interview with the Atlantic, Carlson said he\u2019s been fishing in the river, which stretches from West Virginia into the Chesapeake Bay, for almost 35 years.\n2: \"It has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier,\" he said.\n3: \"I go down there, and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.\"\n4: Asked how he knew immigrants were to blame, Carlson added: \"Because I\u2019m there.\n5: I watch it.\"\n6: We found that Carlson\u2019s claim is at odds with data collected by activists devoted to keeping the Potomac clean, who told us that the river has actually gotten cleaner over time.\n7: Plus, there\u2019s no evidence that immigrants are especially to blame for any trash floating around the river\u2019s waters.\n8: (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.)\n9: Cleaner and cleaner, not dirtier and dirtier The Potomac River has long been considered too polluted for swimming, particularly in and around Washington, D.C., where Carlson lives .\n10: Its waters were so bad that in 1965, former President Lyndon Johnson declared the river a \"national disgrace.\"\n11: But a 2018 report from the Potomac Conservancy, a nonprofit clean-water advocate in the region, found that the Potomac\u2019s overall health has improved dramatically in the last 10 years.\n12: Hedrick Belin, president of the group, blasted Carlson for his \"groundless accusation\" in a statement to PolitiFact, calling the Fox News host\u2019s comments \"factually incorrect\" and \"racist.\"\n13: \"For the first time in generations, we are within reach of fully enjoying a healthy, thriving Potomac River,\" Belin said, noting that river pollutants are in decline as fish are returning.\n14: Other experts agreed.\n15: \"This is a river that's getting cleaner and cleaner, not 'dirtier and dirtier,'\" said Philip Musegaas, vice president of programs and litigation for the Potomac Riverkeeper Network.\n16: The nonprofit called Carlson\u2019s claim \"dead wrong\" in a Facebook post.\n17: Musegaas said plans to upgrade the sewer systems in Washington and Alexandria, Va., should eliminate the \"last sources of untreated sewage pollution\" in the nearby metropolitan area.\n18: Curtis Dalpra, communications manager for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin , said different environmental issues affect different parts of the river, which is more than 380 miles long.\n19: But generally speaking, the river is cleaner than it was 30 years ago.\n20: Still, Carlson was talking specifically about litter, so we also reached out to the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which organizes annual trash cleanups along the riverside and keeps tabs on the total amount of trash and recyclables its volunteers haul out of the Potomac\u2019s shores each year.\n21: According to the foundation\u2019s data , less litter was collected in 2019 than in 2007, even as the number of volunteers increased.\n22: Specifically, the number of trash-and-recyclable-filled bags per volunteer dropped from an average of 2.14 bags in 2007 to 1.20 in 2019.\n23: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com At Fletchers\u2019 Cove \u2014 a spot that, according to the Washington Post , is roughly a 10-minute drive from Carlson\u2019s house \u2014 the average number of bags-per-volunteer went from roughly 2.11 in 2007 to about 1.32 in 2019.\n24: Litter isn\u2019t the main problem Local experts also cast doubt on Carlson\u2019s claim that immigrant litter was at fault.\n25: For starters, litter is not the top pollutant soiling the Potomac River\u2019s waters.\n26: Belin said nutrients and sediment that flow off the land are the main causes for concern.\n27: When they hit the water, they harm wildlife, degrade habitats and taint the water, making it less clean and safe.\n28: Litter is still an issue.\n29: But foreign-born people \u2014 who make up roughly 14% of the population in Washington, D.C., according to the Census Bureau \u2014 are not uniquely prone to littering.\n30: \"Littering is definitely a problem, but it is a problem that knows no color or ethnicity,\" Musegaas said.\n31: \"Tourists litter, residents litter, and people fishing and boating on the river litter.\"\n32: Not only that, but most of the trash that ends up in the Potomac River is not deposited directly, experts said.\n33: Often, trash left in the street or outside in barrels gets swept by rain into the sewer or the river.\n34: Of course, that trash has to come from someone, Dalpra noted.\n35: At some point, it was thrown on the ground or stuffed in the trash.\n36: And in a dense city like Washington, there\u2019s likely more litter to go around than elsewhere.\n37: But that litter \"is really a problem that spans society,\" Dalpra said.\n38: While we won\u2019t discount the possibility that Carlson has spotted immigrants tossing trash in the Potomac, there\u2019s no evidence that the litter \"is left almost exclusively by immigrants.\"",

        "passage": "0: In a lengthy Facebook post , a group called Save the Alamo warned that Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush wants to erect a statue of the Mexican general who led his nation\u2019s forces during the Battle of the Alamo in 1836 on the grounds of the historic mission in San Antonio.\n1: Save the Alamo was created by Rick Range, a former candidate for land commissioner who challenged Bush during the 2018 Republican primary.\n2: In the post, Range described a Dec. 4 meeting of the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission, at which he said new information about Bush\u2019s plans for the site came to light.\n3: \"However, during that hearing, it was revealed that not only do George P. Bush and the GLO intend on moving the Cenotaph outside the boundaries of the Alamo; they also intend to erect a statue of the dictator Santa Anna and a memorial honoring the Mexican Army!\"\n4: Range wrote.\n5: \"I am not making this up.\n6: We know that parts of the Bush plan were going to be horrendous, but it now looks like it will be worse than we ever dreamed.\"\n7: It\u2019s true that the General Land Office, which Bush heads, has proposed moving the cenotaph monument, which honors those Texans who died at the Alamo, to a different location as part of the agency\u2019s planned $450 million project to restore the Alamo.\n8: But there are no plans to build a monument to Santa Anna and the Mexican Army at the Alamo.\n9: Bush shared a series of tweets on Thursday rebutting the allegations in the post and suggesting that the claim has racist roots.\n10: Here are his tweets, presented together: \"One must ask themselves, why am I being accused of honoring the murderous dictator Santa Anna?\"\n11: Bush wrote. \"\n12: Is it because my mother (now a naturalized citizen) is from Mexico?\n13: I was born in Houston, my wife is from San Angelo, and my boys were born-you guessed it- here in Texas.\n14: \"As a United States Navy Veteran, who deployed to Afghanistan, I know exactly what it means to be loyal to the American flag, this country and this great state.\n15: The idea that I would EVER place a statue of Santa Anna at the Alamo is patently false.\n16: Enough is enough.\n17: This is an outright lie, and is quite frankly, flat out racist.\"\n18: There is no mention of constructing a statue or monument of Santa Anna in the official synopsis of the Alamo Master Plan , the restoration project.\n19: The only time Santa Anna is mentioned in the synopsis is during an overview of the different political factions present during the Battle of the Alamo.\n20: San Antonio Council Member Roberto Trevi\u00f1o, who serves on the Alamo Master Plan Management Committee, told the Rivard Report that the statement is \"baseless, and downright ridiculous.\"\n21: \"Among the information and rumors being spread about the plan for the Alamo, this might be one of the most obscene,\" he said.\n22: \"We are honoring our history; we are honoring the truth; we are honoring freedom.\n23: Erecting a statue of Santa Anna does none of these things.\"\n24: Molly Quick, director of government relations for the General Land Office, gave state lawmakers a progress report on implementation of the restoration project in a Dec. 17 email.\n25: There is no mention of Santa Anna or the Mexican Army in her materials.\n26: Commission meeting video not altered During the public meeting of the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission on Dec. 4, designers behind the restoration project sought the commission\u2019s approval to start implementing the first phase of the plan, which includes landscaping and street improvements \u2014 as well as the repair and relocation of the cenotaph to its new location.\n27: Range, who was not present at the meeting, said he was told by others in attendance that one of the speakers presenting the project said there were plans to \"honor Santa Anna\" at the redesigned site.\n28: \"One of the consultants on the design teams made the statement that they were going to honor both sides, including Santa Anna and the Mexican army,\" Range told PolitiFact Texas.\n29: \"If you\u2019re going to honor somebody, that is a statue or a memorial or a monument.\n30: I don\u2019t know how else you would honor somebody.\"\n31: But multiple viewings of the archived video of the hearing reveal that none of the people presenting the project said anything about honoring Santa Anna or constructing a sculpture for him or the Mexican army.\n32: The only mention of Santa Anna came at the end of the presentation, when John Kasman, vice president of PGAV Destinations, spoke about future phases of the project and some details still under consideration.\n33: \"There are multiple stories that occurred upon that south edge that deserve to be told,\" he said, briefly mentioning the position of Santa Anna\u2019s troops as one of those stories.\n34: Range said this was not the remark from the meeting that concerned him \u2014 in fact, he said he thought a plaque showcasing the movement of the Mexican troops during the 1836 battle would be a \"good idea\" for the site.\n35: Even though the video does not show any individual discussing a plan to \"honor\" Santa Anna, Range said he was certain the remark was made at the hearing.\n36: \"What they did was one of their typical ploys \u2014 they went through that video and redacted out that segment that caused the hubbub,\" Range said.\n37: \"They didn\u2019t want people seeing it.\"\n38: David McElroy, the studio manager of TVSA, the public access channel that airs government meetings in San Antonio, said that footage of the Dec. 4 meeting was not edited.\n39: The city uses a vendor that indexes and uploads footage from public meetings to the city\u2019s website.\n40: If technical difficulties arise, the city may need to step in and upload its own version of the footage.\n41: Either way, McElroy said the city \"won\u2019t ever edit a meeting for content,\" including during the Dec. 4 commission meeting.\n42: \"Is this the full record of this meeting?\n43: Absolutely,\" McElroy said.",

        "passage": "0: North Carolina politicians are divided over what should be done with undocumented immigrants after they\u2019re arrested.\n1: After the 2018 election, a new wave of Democratic sheriffs vowed to halt their jails\u2019 practice of holding undocumented immigrants on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.\n2: The sheriffs\u2019 position: if a judge or magistrate grants a person\u2019s release, he or she should be released -- regardless of immigration status.\n3: In response, some Republicans said the sheriffs were endangering public safety, and the GOP-controlled North Carolina legislature passed a bill that would require sheriffs to comply with ICE requests.\n4: But Democratic Gov.\n5: Roy Cooper vetoed it.\n6: Lt. Gov.\n7: Dan Forest, who\u2019s running for governor against Cooper, recently spoke at a press conference about the impact of the Democrats\u2019 decisions.\n8: Speaking about immigrants wanted by ICE, Forest encouraged the media to use certain terms.\n9: \"Please think carefully about the words that you use.\n10: Many of you are going to be struggling to try not to use words like illegal and alien and words like criminal and rapist and murder and child sex offender,\" he said.\n11: \"But if we have tens of thousands of children in our state -- tens of thousands of children in our state that have been victims of these violent criminals already, you have a lifetime, tens of thousands of lifetimes of victims in our state that are going to grow up with that on their mind.\"\n12: His speech can be viewed in a YouTube video , and his claim was first flagged by the liberal American Independent website.\n13: Forest\u2019s claim stuck out to us because it\u2019s not specific to a number or timeframe, but loaded with a hefty accusation.\n14: So we wondered: have undocumented immigrants victimized \"tens of thousands\" of children in North Carolina?\n15: To answer this question, we knew we\u2019d need a credible source that tracks: violent crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the age of the victims of those crimes, and a state-level breakdown of those statistics.\n16: Contacted by PolitiFact, Forest\u2019s campaign cited news stories about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.\n17: But none of the stories verify Forest\u2019s claim that \"tens of thousands\" of children have been victimized by undocumented immigrants.\n18: One big reason Forest\u2019s claim can\u2019t be verified: There is no federal government database or study tracking how many people have been victimized by undocumented immigrants or the age of the victims.\n19: Forest\u2019s campaign says they meant the word \"victim\" in a general sense as much as a legal one.\n20: We\u2019ll get to his argument later.\n21: But first, let\u2019s look at the legal meaning of what Forest said, and whether there\u2019s data to back it up.\n22: \"The thing is, it\u2019s very easy to identify individual cases and want to extrapolate up.\n23: But that is a major, major fallacy in statistics,\" said Charis E. Kubrin, professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California Irvine.\n24: She called Forest\u2019s claim \"very vague and problematic.\"\n25: A familiar claim Generally speaking, Forest\u2019s claim is similar to others made by Republicans.\n26: President Trump, for instance, frequently expresses concern about crimes committed by immigrants who are in America illegally.\n27: But the lack of data makes it difficult to get a clean look at claims like the one Forest made.\n28: ICE doesn\u2019t track crimes committed by immigrants in the United States illegally, nor does it track the age of victims of those crimes, Lindsay Williams, spokeswoman for the agency, told us in an email.\n29: North Carolina-specific data isn\u2019t available, either.\n30: Neither the NC Attorney General\u2019s Office, the State Bureau of Investigation, nor the Department of Public Safety tracks the statistic Forest mentioned, according to spokespeople for those agencies.\n31: Texas is the only state that tracks the immigration status of those convicted on the state level, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n32: Wrong to assume Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn emailed us a list of news stories to back up the Lt. Governor\u2019s statement.\n33: One was a story by WBTV that details 1,020 criminal charges and 407 convictions for immigrants sought by ICE in 2019 but released from NC jails before ICE could obtain custody.\n34: But many of those charges were for driving offenses, larceny and other nonviolent crimes.\n35: And it\u2019s unclear whether the charged immigrants were convicted, or if their victims were children.\n36: \"Two of those examples identify children as the victim,\" Nowrasteh said.\n37: To back up his claim, Forest would \"need 10,000 times as many examples.\"\n38: Dunn also suggested the word \"victim\" refers to an emotional toll on children who aren\u2019t directly involved in a crime.\n39: He noted that, in Charlotte, \"hundreds of families were evacuated from their homes and countless thousands impacted during a 9-hour SWAT standoff with an illegal immigrant accused of kidnapping, strangulation and assault on a female.\"\n40: Still, those numbers and anecdotes don\u2019t back up Forest\u2019s original claim.",

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren among likely voters in California\u2019s Democratic primary, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls .\n32: A spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign attributed all of the ad\u2019s statements, including the claim that firefighters spoke out against the president, to news coverage.\n33: The claim in question, that \"Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,\" comes directly from a TV reporter narrating a news story .\n34: We found Rice wasn\u2019t the only fire leader to criticize Trump\u2019s words.\n35: The Biden ad includes a brief clip of Los Angeles Fire Chief Daryl Osby, pulled from a separate TV interview .\n36: In it, he says the state is \"in extreme climate change right now.\"\n37: That by itself isn\u2019t a biting critique.\n38: But Osby goes on to say in his full interview: \"I personally find that statement unsatisfactory \u2026 It\u2019s very hurtful for all first responders that are putting their lives on the line to protect lives and property.\"\n39: Tom O\u2019Connor, president of the San Francisco Fire Local 798, also criticized Trump\u2019s tweet, telling a TV station after asked about the tweet that, \"Now is not the time for politics.\n40: It\u2019s a time for leadership.\n41: It\u2019s not the \u2018red and blue states of America.\u2019 It\u2019s the United States of America.\"\n42: Finally, Scott Austin, president of the Pasadena Firefighters Association said in a tweet : \"Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong.\n43: The fires in So.\n44: Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management.\n45: Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims.\n46: Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809.\"\n47: The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",

Dale Kooyenga condemned what he called the \"Wisconsin Grinch\" -- the state\u2019s minimum markup law.\n5: The law \u2014 most commonly known for setting baseline prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products \u2014 actually prohibits far more than that, he said.\n6: \"The minimum markup law also forbids retailers from selling most other products below cost,\" said the Brookfield Republican.\n7: \"That makes many doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials technically against the law.\n8: It\u2019s essentially a state-mandated profit margin.\"\n9: Could doorbusters really be illegal?\n10: Let\u2019s dig into the law books.\n11: The history The minimum markup law \u2014 technically called the Unfair Sales Act \u2014 dates back to the Great Depression.\n12: It seeks to ensure fair competition among businesses by taking aim at \"loss leaders\" -- items priced below cost to draw in customers for other purchases, or to drive a competitor out of business.\n13: Several other states have similar laws .\n14: Wisconsin\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau described the law\u2019s origin this way in a 2019 informational paper : The Unfair Sales Act took effect in the 1930s with the intent of preventing predatory pricing by large firms.\n15: It was thought that large firms could reduce prices below cost to levels smaller firms could not match.\n16: Larger firms would incur short-term losses but drive smaller firms out of business.\n17: It was thought the remaining large firms would use near-monopoly power to charge exorbitant prices after smaller firms were mostly forced from the market.\n18: The law itself describes selling below cost as \"a form of deceptive advertising and an unfair method of competition in commerce.\"\n19: These pricing limitations have remained on the books despite efforts from both parties to limit them.\n20: Republican lawmakers proposed repealing the law, or parts of it, in 2015 and 2017, to no avail.\n21: The repeal was opposed by numerous agriculture and business and tourism interests, and favored by just one registered entity \u2014 Walmart, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign .\n22: And in 2019, Democratic Gov.\n23: Tony Evers hit a wall with a budget proposal to repeal the minimum markup for gasoline.\n24: The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection enforces the law, along with local district attorneys.\n25: Violators can face forfeitures of up to $500 for first-time offenders and $2,500 for repeated violations, but there is no active monitoring of pricing since the agency only investigates based on complaints.\n26: For example, someone filed a complaint in 2015 when Meijer, new to the area, was selling bulk instant coffee for $4.98, the Milwaukee Business Journal reported.\n27: But no one has been fined for such a violation in at least a decade, said Ti Gauger, spokesman for the department.\n28: So what exactly is banned?\n29: Limits on retailers The law is best known for its effect on prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products.\n30: Each of these must be marked up 3% above cost by the wholesaler and 6% by the retailer, the statute says.\n31: But the law also says all other products cannot be sold below the seller\u2019s cost under a section titled \"illegality of loss leaders.\"\n32: It says sales under cost \"with the intent or effect of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor, impairs and prevents fair competition, injures public welfare and is unfair competition.\n33: \u2026 Such sales are prohibited.\"\n34: As proof of Kooyenga\u2019s claim, spokesman Chris Rochester pointed to the statutory wording above and a 2017 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that summarized the law as generally prohibiting sales below cost.\n35: That said, the statute does offer a number of exceptions where sales below cost are allowed, including sales for charity, under court order or as part of a government contract.\n36: These are the other five exceptions spelled out in the law: 1.\n37: \"Bona fide\" clearance sales 2.\n38: Prices set to match a competitor\u2019s documented price 3.\n39: Perishable merchandise 4.\n40: Damaged or discontinued merchandise 5.\n41: Pre-closing liquidations sales Statutes can be open to some interpretation, but we\u2019ll assume the \"clearance sales\" referenced are where retailers are clearing out excess stock, or making way for new stock.\n42: And doorbusters won\u2019t always involve matching a competitor\u2019s documented price.\n43: The other three wouldn\u2019t apply to doorbusters.\n44: That leaves a swath of low-priced specials that would appear to violate the law if below cost.\n45: But that\u2019s a key if.\n46: It\u2019s often assumed that doorbuster deals like those on Black Friday are sold below cost, as referenced in reports published by CNBC , the Washington Post and others.\n47: But Jerry O\u2019Brien , an expert on retail industry trends at the University of Wisconsin, said the actual invoice cost is \"incredibly difficult\" to pin down.\n48: That\u2019s because agreements between vendors and retailers often depend on many factors outside of actual production cost.\n49: They can factor in whether one side is providing advertising, whether the vendor provides in-store services, such as keeping the item stocked, and how returns are handled.\n50: For example, the vendor could lower the price by a set percentage if the retailer agrees to simply discard returns instead of sending them back to the vendor.\n51: \"I\u2019m really not sure anyone in the state is openly breaking the law.\n52: I\u2019d say the law has a lot of room for wiggle,\" said O\u2019Brien, executive director of the Kohl\u2019s Center for Retailing Excellence.\n53: \"When you\u2019ve got these giant vendors selling to these giant retailers, they\u2019re negotiating some amazing invoices that would probably stand up (to the law\u2019s requirements).\"\n54: Kooyenga\u2019s office did not respond to a request for evidence of specific retailers that have sold below cost in Wisconsin.",

Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption straight at the heart of the presidential election of 2020,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n2: \"The president knows this, which is why he has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document.\"\n3: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The White House did release summaries of Trump\u2019s April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n4: But when we examined whether the administration transmitted any other records to Congress, we found that it defied the House\u2019s multiple requests and subpoenas for documents.\n5: In a statement to PolitiFact, a White House official said the call readouts are \"what matters.\"\n6: \"The White House raised well-recognized presidential privileges in response to these document requests,\" the official said.\n7: \"House Democrats chose not to address those privileges, clinging instead to an artificial impeachment deadline on their sham proceeding.\"\n8: The White House pledged not to cooperate In early October , the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed the White House for Ukraine-related documents that Democrats had requested but not received.\n9: In response, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Congress saying the executive branch would not be participating in the investigation.\n10: At the White House\u2019s direction, several top administration officials also defied subpoenas seeking testimony or documents.\n11: The night before European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland was expected to testify, for example, his attorneys received a last-minute call from the State Department informing them that the Trump administration would not allow his testimony.\n12: Sondland eventually testified against the White House\u2019s orders and in response to a subpoena , but his recollections in both his private and public testimony were limited because the White House refused to turn over documents and call records.\n13: Nine administration officials defied similar subpoenas from the House.\n14: \"The executive branch cannot be expected to, and will not participate in, this exercise of partisan political theater,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement .\n15: House Democrats elected not to take the issue up in court.\n16: Instead, they packaged Trump\u2019s efforts to block cooperation into an article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress.\n17: The obstruction of Congress article, which the House approved by a 229-198 margin, charges Trump with \"directing\" the White House and various executive branch agencies \"to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of documents.\"\n18: What documents did Congress get?\n19: According to the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees\u2019 reports, \"not a single document\" was produced by the White House, the vice president\u2019s office, the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, the Defense Department or the Energy Department.\n20: In total, those agencies received \"71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records,\" the committees\u2019 reports said.\n21: The House did obtain some documents, such as text messages that former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker exchanged with Sondland and other U.S. and Ukrainian diplomats, that were in witnesses\u2019 \"personal possession,\" according to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s report .\n22: But multiple witnesses testified to the existence of other key White House documents that Congress never received.\n23: These materials included: \u2022 Talking points prepared ahead of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European affairs at the National Security Council.\n24: \u2022\u00a0Notes taken during Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky by Vindman and by Tim Morrison , the former top Russia expert on the NSC.\n25: \u2022\u00a0A memo prepared by Vindman that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was expected to present to Trump conveying \"the consensus views from the entire deputies small group\" that \"the security assistance be released.\"\n26: \u2022 Call records between Trump and Sondland.\n27: \u2022 Notes from NSC legal advisor John Eisenberg detailing his discussions with Vindman about a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official , during which Sondland suggested that investigations could help secure a White House meeting for Zelensky.\n28: \u2022\u00a0The readout of Trump\u2019s Sept. 25 meeting with Zelensky in New York.\n29: The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Republican minority report does not dispute that Trump\u2019s White House withheld these and other documents.\n30: But it notes that Trump made readouts of his April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Zelensky publicly available, calling them \"directly relevant.\"\n31: Himes spokesman Patrick Malone said the readouts were released in response to public pressure rather than congressional subpoenas.\n32: The White House published the July 25 call summary on Sept. 25, days after news of the whistleblower complaint broke and one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the House impeachment inquiry.\n33: \"They weren\u2019t released to Congress in response to our requests,\" Malone said.\n34: \"They were released to the public.\"",

        "passage": "0: U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., applauded the University of Missouri following its announcement that the university\u2019s Confucius Institute will shut down in August.\n1: \"Pleased Mizzou is shutting down the#China Communist Party funded \u2018Confucius Institute.\u2019 As the State Department warned Mizzou in July 2019, and as I have repeatedly stated, this program presented security risks for students & university as a whole,\" Hawley tweeted Jan. 15.\n2: Hawley has criticized the Confucius Institute and raised questions about the program in the past, including when he sent a letter to MU Chancellor Alexander Cartwright on July 24 urging him to \"reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on (Mizzou\u2019s) campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government.\"\n3: That wasn\u2019t the first time a politician urged a university to shut down its Confucius Institute program citing threats to security; Texas A&M closed its program after two U.S. representatives wrote a letter recommending the action to four Texas universities.\n4: We decided to look into whether the State Department really warned Mizzou in July about security risks arising from a Confucius Institute program.\n5: We found a letter, but struggled to find a warning.\n6: The controversy Mizzou\u2019s Confucius Institute is one of about 500 established worldwide by Hanban, a subsidiary of the Chinese Ministry of Education.\n7: Hanban\u2019s website describes Confucius Institutes as nonprofit, public institutions that \"aim to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries.\"\n8: Hawley criticized Hanban in his letter to Cartwright, saying that it is governed by leaders of 12 Chinese ministries, including those that handle media and propaganda.\n9: He also said universities that partner with Hanban sign contracts that prohibit \"tarnishing the reputation\" of Hanban, and they send teachers and textbooks designed to promote a positive image of China.\n10: In the United States and across the globe, universities have been shutting down their programs amid concerns and investigations.\n11: BBC News reported in September 2019 that a \"flurry\" of universities worldwide had closed their programs in the preceding weeks.\n12: Mizzou announced on Jan. 14 that its contract with the Confucius Institute will be terminated, effective in August, according to a news release from the university .\n13: The main reason: a change in State Department guidelines that now requires a certified Mandarin teacher to accompany classrooms with Confucius Institute staff members.\n14: The Confucius Institute instructors were classified as interns on exchange visas, not teachers.\n15: The university said it would cost too much to make the changes in categories.\n16: DOWNLOAD THE LETTER The release says the State Department notified Mizzou in a July letter.\n17: Hawley\u2019s press secretary confirmed with us this is the same letter he was referring to in his tweet.\n18: So, did the State Department warn Mizzou that the Confucius Institute presented security risks?\n19: MU spokesperson Christian Basi provided us the July 15 letter from the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\n20: It was signed by Henry C. Scott, director of the Office of Private Sector Exchange Program Administration.\n21: There\u2019s no direct warning given by the State Department here.\n22: The letter was meant to notify Mizzou of violations in its Confucius Institute program that were found by the department and address how to fix them.\n23: The letter states the exchange program administration attempts to help sponsors of a Confucius Institute program correct errors when the office notices them.\n24: It addressed specific areas of concern.\n25: The first area of concern was Confucius Institute student interns teaching in K-12 classrooms without a supervisor who speaks Mandarin.\n26: The language barrier \"creates a vulnerability, as efficacy of the co-teacher\u2019s supervision is severely limited,\" the letter states.\n27: If that is a warning about security, it\u2019s pretty opaque.\n28: The other areas of concern listed were failures to comply with required form signatures and worker\u2019s compensation policies, improperly listing Confucius Institute student interns\u2019 primary site of activity and misusing a \"Research Scholar\" role defined by the department.\n29: There is no specific mention of potential risks to students or Mizzou in the letter.",

        "passage": "0: One of North Carolina\u2019s more obscure political races will feature familiar opponents.\n1: Wayne Goodwin, the chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, plans to challenge Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.\n2: They faced off in 2016.\n3: On Twitter this weekend, Goodwin cast himself as the more serious and experienced candidate, having held the office from 2009 to 2017.\n4: Causey was the first Republican to be elected to the office this century, when he won election in 2016.\n5: In a tweet , Goodwin referred to Causey as a \"30 (year) perennial candidate for (the) same office.\"\n6: It takes a lot of money and energy to run one campaign, much less multiple campaigns over the course of three decades.\n7: That level of commitment is uncommon.\n8: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So we wondered: how many times has Causey run for insurance commissioner over the last 30 years?\n9: There have been seven elections for Insurance Commissioner since 1990.\n10: Causey, who has a background in the insurance industry, ran in many of them -- but not all of them.\n11: Race history Here\u2019s a look back each race for Insurance Commissioner over the last 30 years, and whether Causey participated.\n12: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Note: Goodwin should\u2019ve known a little about the Republican in the 2008 election , since he won the seat by beating a different candidate -- John Odom.\n13: If Causey follows through with his plan to run for re-election in 2020 (he already filed to run ), he\u2019ll have run in six of the last eight elections, or 75\u00a0percent of them.\n14: Other campaigns Goodwin specifically noted Causey\u2019s history of running for the \"same\" office.\n15: This could be interpreted to mean Causey has only ever run for one office.\n16: That\u2019s not the case.\n17: In 2014, Causey ran for Congress in the 6th Congressional District.\n18: But he didn\u2019t make the November ballot, having placed seventh in the Republican primary that May.\n19: He also ran for state Senate in 2002, the race in District 28 to Democrat Katie Dorsett.\n20: Goodwin has some other races on his record, too.\n21: In 2004, he lost a bid to unseat Republican Cherie Berry as Labor Commissioner.\n22: Two years before that, he won an NC House race.\n23: And in 1996, Goodwin was elected to the NC House after running unopposed.\n24: Another meaning Finally, let\u2019s look at the term \"perennial candidate.\"\n25: The word can be a bit squishy, as an Ohio newspaper columnist once pointed out .\n26: Goodwin told us he used the term only to communicate that Causey has run frequently, and in that sense he\u2019s right.\n27: He also pointed out that, if had intended to say Causey ran in every election since 1990, he would\u2019ve used the word \" quadrennial \" -- meaning someone who runs every four years.\n28: However, used in the context of politics, the term \"perennial candidate\" often refers to candidates who don\u2019t have much of a shot at winning.\n29: Major media outlets have used the term not only to describe someone who runs frequently -- but someone who almost always loses, and runs despite having questionable qualifications and/or low odds of winning.\n30: NPR in 2011 used the term to describe frequent presidential candidates U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, and Alan Keyes.\n31: The Associated Press has used the term to describe a Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Mississippi who once promised to establish a series of snow-cone stands to fund state services.\n32: The AP used the term again in 2019 to describe a \"cult-like figure\" and conspiracy theorist who ran one of his several presidential campaigns from prison.\n33: Causey\u2019s different from most candidates because he\u2019s won elected office, represented a major political party in the five elections he didn\u2019t win, and has a background in the insurance industry.",

        "passage": "0: There is no doubt the United States is a magnet for immigrants, but with a crackdown on both illegal and legal immigration under President Donald Trump, how does it compare with other countries when it comes to providing residency?\n1: According to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, the U.S. continues to outpace other nations when it comes to granting permanent residency to people entering the country.\n2: \"There is not another nation on Earth, other than the United States of America, that grants legal permanent residency to more than a million people per year,\" Johnson tweeted Nov. 13, 2019.\n3: The tweet featured a clip of Johnson speaking at a Senate hearing that day discussing migration rates over the past year.\n4: Is Johnson right?\n5: The language Johnson uses the term \"legal permanent residency,\" which the Department of Homeland Security defines as non-citizens lawfully authorized to permanently live in the U.S.\n6: They can also be referred to as \"green card\" holders.\n7: Legal permanent residents, or LPRs, are allowed to work without special restrictions, own property, receive financial aid for higher education and join the military.\n8: Though they have the majority of the same rights as a U.S. citizen, green card holders can\u2019t vote in any federal elections and typically are barred from voting in state and local elections as well.\n9: When traveling out of the country, authorities may also scrutinize green card holders more than citizens, especially if they intend to be out of the country for a significant length of time.\n10: Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration rates, said the \"legal permanent residency\" pathway to citizenship is not used in most other countries outside the United States.\n11: \"LPRs, if they live in the U.S. for 5 years, 3 years if (they\u2019re) spouses of citizens, can get U.S. citizenship -- assuming they do not commit a serious crime,\" Camarota told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email.\n12: \"Other countries admit foreigners for long-term temporary work or study or they even grant them asylum, etc.\n13: \"But, in most cases, they do not offer them a clear path to citizenship.\n14: In that sense, the U.S. is different.\"\n15: Limiting entry We asked Johnson\u2019s office for backup on this claim, but they did not respond.\n16: According to the Brookings Institution , a left-leaning think tank, hardline rhetoric and policies under Trump may be having an impact on the declining rate of immigrants into the U.S.\n17: In 2018, the foreign-born population in the U.S. rose by 203,000, the lowest level since the first year of the Great Recession in 2007.\n18: Over the past decade, the annual increase has ranged between 400,000 and 1 million.\n19: The total number of foreign-born people residing in the U.S. in 2018 was 45 million.\n20: Of that number, roughly 22.6 million were naturalized citizens and 22.1 were noncitizens -- with half that number estimated to be residing illegally, according to Brookings.\n21: According to Department of Homeland Security data from 2017, the most recent year available, the number of people who were given legal permanent residence in the U.S. was still over 1.1 million.\n22: How does that compare with other nations?\n23: Global comparison Camarota said Canada, Australia and New Zealand are the closest to the U.S. when it comes to granting legal permanent residencies that could lead to eventual citizenship.\n24: The Canadian government set out a three-year plan that aims to provide residency to 1 million new immigrants between 2018 and 2020.\n25: In 2018, Canada exceeded its goal of accepting 310,000 permanent residents by about 10,000.\n26: The target for 2019 was set at about 313,000, while 2020 is set at 340,000.\n27: Earlier this year, Australia limited its migration cap to accepting only 160,000 permanent new residents a year over the next four years, with its government emphasizing border protection.\n28: New Zealand accepted 142,900 migrants in 2018, which their government considered a high number.\n29: Through May 2019, roughly 144,900 migrants arrived in the country this year.\n30: Regardless, those numbers all fall short of the U.S. What about European countries that have dealt with an influx of refugees from war-torn Syria?\n31: A record 1.3 million migrants applied for asylum across the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Norway and Switzerland in 2015.\n32: Though asylum is often temporary, these numbers do show an increase in the number of people being taken in across Europe.\n33: Even at the height of admitting asylum seekers, though, no country topped 1 million.\n34: In 2015, Germany admitted around 890,000 refugees, according to the English-language German news site, the Local.\n35: Robert Warren, a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, said despite immigration upticks from other nations, the U.S. is still in the lead.\n36: \"No other country admits nearly as many immigrants as the United States over long periods,\" Warren said.",

Sheila Jackson Lee: \"Homicide is the leading cause of murder.\"\n4: By former Vice President Joe Biden: \"No ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights.\"\n5: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n6: : \"Having an abortion is no different than having one\u2019s tonsils removed.\"\n7: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: \"Owning guns is not a right.\n8: If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution.\"\n9: Let\u2019s scrutinize these quotes one by one.\n10: Jackson Lee The quote attributed to Jackson Lee appears to come from a now-defunct blog called the Habanero of Texas.\n11: That post, or excerpts of it, was widely shared by other conservatives and pro-gun advocates on social media and in forums.\n12: According to one blog that quoted the original Habanero of Texas post, Jackson Lee \"held an informal press conference today announcing that her administration, through great efforts and much expense, had completed a decade-old study that focused on the cause of murders in the United States.\n13: She was reported as saying that the results were predominantly leaning towards \u2018homicide\u2019 as being the primary cause for the murders.\"\n14: The original post appears to have been an attempt at satire, since the direct \"quote\" attributed by the blog to Jackson Lee is nearly unintelligible: \"Datas (sic) uncover (sic) today give us a clearer portrait of a couple of possible cause (sic) for murder, but let\u2019s be clear.. Changes in the atmospheres (sic) and combustibles (sic) also play a roles (sic) in how peoples (sic) are behave (sic).\n15: By continuing homicide (sic) and climate changes (sic) we are ascend (sic) ourselves to vulnables (sic), and we cannot deny that, Nor shall we, Nor shall I, Nor shall we all, So say we all (sic).\n16: End homicide and end climate change, and we end murder.\n17: THIS, we know.\"\n18: The apparent satire may have been inspired by remarks posted by the Blaze, a conservative website, that Jackson made in 2013 .\n19: She said in part, \"Homicide is the leading cause of death \u2014 second-leading cause of death \u2014 for young people ages 15 to 24.\n20: In my community, African Americans, it is the leading cause of death for those 10 to 24.\"\n21: Biden The statement is not authentic and has circulated the internet for years .\n22: We have rated it False .\n23: This quote spiraled out of a comment Biden made during a weapons control forum in 2013, but it has been altered and taken out of context.\n24: A YouTube video posted in 2015 and titled \"Biden: no ordinary American cares about his constitutional rights\" has more than 33,000 views.\n25: The YouTube video tracks back to a February 2013 address Biden gave during a forum held at Western Connecticut State University, about two months after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting.\n26: At no point during the video does Biden say the words cited in the social media posts.\n27: In the clip, he talks about the \"roadblocks\" that are put up by those who oppose gun control: \"They say all you\u2019re going to do is deny law-abiding citizens their rights under the Second Amendment.\n28: Not true.\n29: They say guns like the AR-15 are needed for self-protection and recreation.\n30: They are not.\n31: There are plenty of ways you can protect yourself and recreate without an AR-15.\n32: They say it isn\u2019t about guns.\n33: They\u2019re wrong; it is about guns.\n34: Let me say at the outset to all the press: No law abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their Constitutional rights will be infringed in any way.\n35: None, zero.\n36: Look, common sense facts are these assault weapons are unnecessary and dangerous weapons that put our law enforcement personnel at risk\u2026\" Warren Warren did make a comparison between abortion and tonsil removal procedures, but the quote shared in the post is heavily edited and is not something Warren said or wrote.\n37: We have rated it Mostly False .\n38: In a Jan. 21, 2018, opinion column in Time magazine, she wrote: \"On the 45th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade , I think about what has changed since abortions became legal.\n39: Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe vs. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out.\n40: A lot of women are alive today because of Roe.\"\n41: She made similar statements in a Senate floor speech and an opinion column published in Marie Claire magazine in July 2018.\n42: In the piece, Warren links to a Time magazine article , which reported in 2014 that women who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their wisdom teeth removed, citing a study published in the peer-reviewed Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal.\n43: Ocasio-Cortez We didn\u2019t find any credible sources corroborating her purported comment.\n44: We rated the claim that she said it Pants on Fire .\n45: Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign website said of gun control policy, \"Cities and states with strong gun laws have managed to cut gun violence significantly without running afoul of the Second Amendment.\n46: Alexandria believes that supporting common-sense gun legislation is necessary for any politician who claims to care about the lives of constituents.\"\n47: Her campaign platform also said she thinks that \"it\u2019s clear that the founding fathers did not have assault weapons in mind when they wrote\" the Second Amendment, and that she advocates for banning such guns.\n48: Among other gun control measures, she thinks domestic abusers and stalkers should have to surrender their firearms, and she wants to require universal and improved background checks before someone can buy a gun.\n49: \"Keep the severely mentally ill and people with a history of domestic abuse from purchasing guns,\" Ocasio-Cortez said about a year ago while answering questions on Reddit.\n50: \"I am a believer in the Second Amendment but this is where I draw the line.\"\n51: All told, each of the four quotes is either made up or seriously mangled.",

        "passage": "0: As cases of opioid use disorder continue to wreak havoc across the U.S., many states have taken steps to address the issue.\n1: Missouri is one of more than 30 states that brought a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers, alleging the companies misrepresented the dangerous and addictive nature of the drugs.\n2: Speaking at a roundtable discussion about the opioid epidemic Nov. 25, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who inherited Missouri\u2019s lawsuit when he took office, said, \"You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses.\n3: That\u2019s like a passenger plane going down every day of every week of every month of every year of every decade.\"\n4: Stating that 140 deaths per day are caused by opioid-related overdoses emphasizes the high stakes of the opioid crisis, so we wanted to see if Schmitt\u2019s number was correct.\n5: Here\u2019s what we found: He\u2019s off by about 10.\n6: Preliminary data for last year shows fewer deaths.\n7: The numbers When asked about where Schmitt found the statistic, Chris Nuelle, the attorney general\u2019s press secretary, said that opioid-related research can fluctuate, so it can be hard to get exact numbers.\n8: He also noted that Schmitt has often attributed 130 deaths per day to opioids, though Nuelle believes the 140 number is still accurate.\n9: Nuelle pointed to a National Institute on Drug Abuse article that attributed more than 130 deaths per day and provided the link to a U.S. News & World Report story that analyzed opioid data, but did not indicate the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses each day at all.\n10: The most reliable and most recent data available on drug and opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n11: The CDC\u2019s most recent data was released in 2018 and analyzes 2017 drug and opioid overdose deaths.\n12: In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States.\n13: Of those deaths, 47,600 \u2014 or 67.8% of all drug overdose deaths \u2014 involved some type of opioids whether natural, synthetic or semisynthetic.\n14: When you break these statistics down into deaths per day, there were approximately 192 drug overdose deaths each day on average in 2017.\n15: Of those 192 deaths, about 130 each day involved an opioid.\n16: This statistic does not match up exactly with Schmitt\u2019s claim that there are 140 opioid-related deaths daily in the U.S. Jasmine Reed, a public affairs specialist at the CDC, said in an email that the 130 daily deaths from opioid overdoses is an average calculated by dividing the total number of opioid overdoses in the year by the number of days in a year.\n17: She said this means the number is not an absolute figure, but that it is more accurate to say there are 130 opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. each day than it is to say there are 140.\n18: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The CDC estimates that between 1999 and 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose, and about 399,000 of those deaths were due to opioid overdoses.\n19: Overall, the number of opioid overdose deaths each day and drug overdose deaths each day have both been steadily increasing within that time period.\n20: If the number of opioid overdose deaths continued growing steadily, as it has in past years, the number of deaths each day in 2019 might, in fact, be 140 or even exceed 140.\n21: However, this is not yet known because the final counts of overdose deaths for 2018 and 2019 have not been released.\n22: The CDC has released provisional data for 2018 that indicates the number of drug overdose deaths dropped from 70,237 in 2017 to 68,110 in 2018.\n23: The CDC warns that this number is likely \"underreported due to incomplete data,\" but the overall drop suggests that opioid-related overdoses also decreased in 2018.\n24: This could mean the number of opioid overdose deaths is actually less than 130 per day.\n25: Reasons for overdoses Aaron Williams, senior director for training and technical assistance for substance abuse at the National Council For Behavioral Health, explained there are a number of reasons why opioid overdose deaths constitute such a large portion of drug overdose deaths.\n26: \"Over the last decade and a half, there has been a significant increase in the prescription of and use of opioid-based medications for pain, in particular,\" Williams said.\n27: He said many people developed substance use problems due to this uptick, which increased overdose deaths because high doses of opioids can cause respiratory depression that leads to death.\n28: Williams also said in recent years illegal opioids have become easier to get, with heroin getting \"cheaper and purer\" as one example.\n29: He said potent synthetic opioids (tramadol, fentanyl, etc.)\n30: have moved into the pipeline as well.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: Former Vice President Joe Biden has continued to recast what advice he gave President Barack Obama about whether to raid the compound that was the suspected hideaway for Osama bin Laden.\n1: Biden\u2019s latest statement occurred during a brief exchange with Fox News reporter Peter Doocy in Iowa on Jan. 3, following President Donald Trump\u2019s order to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n2: Doocy: \"As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you can stop an imminent attack on Americans but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terror leader, would you pull the trigger?\"\n3: Biden: \"Well, we did.\n4: Guy\u2019s name was Osama bin Laden.\"\n5: Doocy: \"Didn\u2019t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?\"\n6: Biden: \"No, I didn\u2019t.\n7: I didn\u2019t.\"\n8: It is a challenge to fact-check what Biden told Obama in advance of the May 2011 raid to kill bin Laden, because their conversations were largely private.\n9: However, Biden has made conflicting statements about what he told Obama.\n10: In 2012, Biden said he told Obama \"don\u2019t go\" and called for him to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound.\n11: But in 2015, Biden said he told Obama \"go.\"\n12: In 2012 Biden said he told Obama not to launch raid on compound In January 2012 at a Democratic congressional retreat, Biden recounted how Obama asked senior officials whether they should go ahead with the raid.\n13: Everyone in the room \"hedged their bet\" except CIA Director Leon Panetta, who said \"go.\"\n14: \"Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go,\" Biden recounted.\n15: \"\u2018We have to do two more things to see if he's there.\"\n16: (He did not explain what the two additional things were at the time.)\n17: (When a reporter asked White House spokesman Jay Carney in 2012 about Biden\u2019s comments stating he was against the raid, Carney said: \"I know that he is speaking accurately.\")\n18: In May 2012 on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press , Biden said he told Obama \"follow your instincts.\"\n19: \"I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there,\" Biden said.\n20: Obama\u2019s statement during a debate in 2012 supported the idea that Biden was critical about the raid proposal.\n21: Obama said that \"even some in my own party, including my current vice president,\" critiqued the proposed raid.\n22: Biden later said he told Obama to go ahead with the raid By 2013, Biden started to recast his account of what he told Obama.\n23: In January 2013, the New York Times magazine wrote that Biden had advised against the 2011 raid on the house in Pakistan that was suspected to be bin Laden\u2019s hideaway.\n24: But the quote by Biden was more vague: \"I remember walking up to his office and saying, \u2018Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.\u2019\" In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden.\n25: On Oct. 20, 2015, at an event honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden said when Obama asked everyone in the room whether he should go forward, only two were definitive: Panetta said \"go\" and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said \"don\u2019t go.\"\n26: Biden recounted that he suggested a third option, though he said it was one \"that I didn\u2019t really think we should do.\"\n27: Biden said he proposed to take one more pass with an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm that it was bin Laden at the compound.\n28: Then Biden said he told Obama in a private conversation, \"I thought he should go but to follow his own instincts.\"\n29: That led to multiple news reports showing that Biden had revised his account from 2012 when he said he told Obama \"don\u2019t go.\"\n30: Days later, CBS journalist Norah O\u2019Donnell asked Biden to clear up the confusion about whether he told Obama to conduct the raid.\n31: \"Everything I said was completely accurate.\n32: I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story,\" he said, referring to the Mondale event.\n33: Biden said he first told Obama to do another check, and then he told Obama to follow his own instincts: \"I said, \u2018You should do that, and there would be still time to have the raid, but that\u2019s what I would do.\"\n34: Biden continued: \"Immediately, we got up, as we always do, and I walked out with the president.\n35: We walked up to the Oval.\n36: I said, \u2018Mr.\n37: President, follow your instincts.\n38: I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.\u2019 \" Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign pushed back against criticism that his statements have been inconsistent.\n39: The campaign said in a statement that at the outset, Biden advised that the United States should first obtain additional confirmation that bin Laden was at the compound.\n40: Biden, the campaign said, never proposed stopping the operation.\n41: Obama-era officials said Biden expressed skepticism Biden\u2019s claim that he told Obama to \"go\" conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books.\n42: (A Trump campaign spokesman, Zach Parkinson, tweeted many of these passages.)\n43: Obama\u2019s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in \" Hard Choices\" that Biden \"remained skeptical.\"\n44: Panetta wrote in \" Worthy Fights \" that Biden \"argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.\"\n45: Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in \" Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War \" that he and Biden were the \"two primary skeptics.\"\n46: \"Biden\u2019s primary concern was the political consequences of failure,\" Gates wrote.",

Soleimani.\n1: In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Jan. 6, Haley praised Trump\u2019s actions to take out Soleimani with a drone strike of his vehicle near the airport outside Baghdad.\n2: While the world knows that he was \"evil,\" Haley said, she accused top Democrats of grieving his loss.\n3: \"You don\u2019t see anyone standing up for Iran,\" Haley said.\n4: \"You are not hearing any of the Gulf members, you are not hearing China, you are not hearing Russia.\n5: The only ones that are mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates.\"\n6: Haley proceeded to tweet out her statement .\n7: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But Haley is wrong in counting top Democrats among the mourners of Soleimani.\n8: RELATED FACT-CHECK: Haley wrongly says Congress had no input on Iran nuclear deal Leading Democrats running for president The five Democrats who have qualified so far for the Jan. 14 debate in Iowa \u2014 Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar \u2014 all expressed concern about the potential for Trump\u2019s strike on Soleimani to escalate tensions and prompt a rush for war.\n9: However, four of the five prefaced their comments by saying that Soleimani was a dangerous man with blood on his hands.\n10: None had anything close to praise for him or sympathy for his death.\n11: Here are some of the statements by these Democrats: Biden : In a written statement , the former vice president said that \"no American will mourn Qassem Soleimani\u2019s passing.\"\n12: He added that Soleimani deserved to be brought to justice and \"supported terror and sowed chaos.\"\n13: Biden said Trump owes Americans an explanation of his strategy and how he plans to keep troops safe.\n14: \"I hope the administration has thought through the second- and third-order consequences of the paths they have chosen,\" Biden wrote.\n15: Later, on Jan. 3 , Biden made a similar statement, criticizing Soleimani as the \"architect of the slaughter of countless lives in the region\" and stating that \"no American mourns his passing.\"\n16: He said Americans don\u2019t want another war in the Middle East and that Trump shouldn\u2019t take us to war without congressional approval .\n17: Warren : The Massachusetts senator\u2019s message evolved in the days after the airstrike.\n18: But nothing she wrote could be considered an expression of \"mourning.\"\n19: In her initial tweet , she explicitly called Soleimani \"a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans.\"\n20: She went on to call Trump\u2019s action \"reckless\" and something that \"escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict.\"\n21: In a second tweet , she didn\u2019t repeat the preface criticizing Soleimani, nor did she in comments to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n22: Instead, she focused on criticizing Trump for his handling of policy toward Iran.\n23: In these later statements, Warren said nothing positive about Soleimani.\n24: Buttigieg : In a statement , the former South Bend, Ind., mayor said that Soleimani was a threat who \"masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies, leading to hundreds of deaths.\"\n25: In addition, in Iowa, Buttigieg said Soleimani has \"blood on his hands\" and that \"taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what comes next.\"\n26: Buttigieg called for a deliberative approach that includes working with Congress and U.S. allies and said we must prepare for the potential of escalation.\n27: Buttigieg tweeted that Trump owes American troops a strategy and should give Americans answers.\n28: Klobuchar : In her statement after the airstrike, the Minnesota senator criticized the \"timing, manner, and potential consequences of the administration\u2019s actions.\"\n29: But she prefaced this by saying that \"Qassem Soleimani was responsible for directing Iran\u2019s destabilizing actions in Iraq, Syria, and throughout the Middle East, including attacks against U.S.\n30: forces.\"\n31: Sanders : The Vermont senator\u2019s written statement had nothing positive to say about Soleimani, focusing instead on how the \"assassination\" by Trump was a \"dangerous escalation\" that \"brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.\"\n32: He said much the same in a streamed campaign event he tweeted out , briefly mentioning Soleimani but neither explicitly criticizing or praising him.\n33: In an interview with CNN , Sanders called him a \"bad news guy\" but focused more on his opposition to going to war with Iran.\n34: Several other Democratic presidential candidates also made a point of criticizing Soleimani.\n35: Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said on MSNBC that \"Soleimani has American blood on his hands.\"\n36: Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said in a statement that Soleimani \"has the blood of Americans and our allies on his hands\" and \"there is no mourning his death.\"\n37: Businessman Tom Steyer tweeted that Soleimani was \"a terrorist responsible for killing Americans.\"\n38: And former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted that Soleimani \"was a murderer with the blood of Americans on his hands.\"\n39: The Democratic leadership Top congressional Democrats echoed the critiques offered by the presidential candidates.\n40: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had harsh words for Soleimani while criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s actions, calling the general a \"notorious terrorist\" and saying that \"no one should shed a tear over his death.\"\n41: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did not dwell on Soleimani in either of two statements released after the operation.\n42: She said in her first statement that the airstrike was \"provocative and disproportionate\" and in a later statement that it raised \"urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification\" for the operation.\n43: Neither of her statements made any effort to mourn Soleimani.\n44: Other leading Democrats on foreign policy issues, including Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn ., and Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y. , also criticized Soleimani.\n45: A response from Haley\u2019s spokesman included such a broad interpretation of the word \"mourning\" to render its definition meaningless, saying Democrats are \"effectively\" mourning Soleimani by questioning whether the United States is better off after his killing.",

        "passage": "0: A viral Facebook post depicts President Donald Trump as a generous airline owner who donated his planes to transport American soldiers home from Saudi Arabia in 1991.\n1: But the details don\u2019t square with what happened.\n2: The post features a letter purportedly written by a man named Ron Knouse.\n3: He describes how he and other soldiers had to wait four days for buses to the airport because there was a shortage of planes at the end of Operation Desert Storm.\n4: \"Finally, the buses came and took the young man to the airport.\n5: The planes waiting were from Tower Air.\n6: The owner of Tower Air had volunteered his planes and staff to bring soldiers home for the cost of fuel only.\n7: Happily, the young veteran got home just in time for Easter weekend in 1991 and spent that time emotionally healing with friends and family surrounding him\u2026 \"The Airline owner \u2013 Donald J Trump.\n8: \"This needs to go viral.\n9: He\u2019s done so many good things you never hear about.\"\n10: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n11: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n12: Donald Trump did operate an airline at one time.\n13: But the details of the letter are inaccurate.\n14: Trump did not own Tower Air, and we found no evidence he assisted in the transport of military personnel from Saudi Arabia.\n15: Beyond that, Trump\u2019s airline \u2014 Trump Shuttle \u2014 was being controlled by a consortium of banks, not Trump, when the United States military chartered flights from the airline for personnel transport.\n16: That was for flights within the United States, not from Saudi Arabia.\n17: The end of Trump Shuttle A different story about a Trump plane transporting 200 marines from North Carolina to Florida after Operation Desert Storm in 1991 emerged when conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity aired a now-deleted segment about it in May 2016, during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n18: In that version, about 200 Marines took two trips on a Trump-owned plane from North Carolina to Florida after a logistics error left them stranded.\n19: While Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign allegedly confirmed the story, details show that he was not personally involved in transporting any American troops.\n20: Trump ran the airline for a short time.\n21: In May 1989, he purchased Eastern Airlines for $365 million, renaming it Trump Shuttle.\n22: The airline operated short flights in the northeastern United States using a fleet of Boeing 727 airliners.\n23: A 2016 fact-check by the Washington Post reported that while some Trump Shuttle planes did transport military personnel around the country in the early 1990s, it was the U.S. military that chartered those flights, not Trump personally.\n24: Retired Lt. Gen. Vernon Kondra, who was in charge of all military airlift operations at the time, told the newspaper his notes indicated several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the country.\n25: He said it would have made little sense if Trump personally arranged the flights and said he was \"certainly not aware\" of him being involved.\n26: Trump wasn\u2019t in a position to donate plane rides, anyway.\n27: NYC Aviation reported that he had defaulted on his loan in September 1990, and control of the airline went back to the banks until it was sold to US Air.\n28: US Air agreed in late 1991 to operate the airline with an option to buy it outright after five years.\n29: By April 1992 , Trump Shuttle had ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle.\n30: Tower Air Trump\u2019s name does not appear anywhere in the nearly 20-year history of Tower Air, which is mentioned as being owned by Trump in the Facebook post.\n31: The airline contracted with the Department of Defense to transport soldiers on charter flights in the early 1990s and was founded by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi and Sam Fondlier in 1982, according to Airline History records .\n32: When Tower Air filed for bankruptcy in May 2000, Nachtomi was listed as its CEO.\n33: To summarize our findings, Trump Shuttle planes were contracted by the U.S. military to transport personnel around the country while the airline was in the process of being sold; it was not under Trump\u2019s control at the time.\n34: Trump was not affiliated with Tower Air, which contracted with the Department of Defense in the 1990s to transport soldiers stationed overseas.",

        "passage": "0: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In a series of tweets justifying the U.S. killing of Qassem Soleimani, Vice President Mike Pence said that among the Iranian military leader\u2019s \"worst atrocities\" was helping 9/11 terrorists.\n1: Soleimani \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,\" Pence tweeted Jan. 3.\n2: The U.S. Defense Department on Jan. 2 announced it had killed Soleimani, who commanded the Quds Force in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n3: The Trump administration said the killing was a defensive action and that Soleimani was developing plans to attack American diplomats and troops in Iraq and the region.\n4: PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at Pence\u2019s claim that Soleimani assisted the men who carried out the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n5: There\u2019s no evidence to support his statement, and his press secretary did not provide information that directly tied Soleimani to the travel of the 9/11 terrorists.\n6: Iran and terrorists\u2019 travel to Afghanistan The 9/11 terrorist attacks were carried out by 19 men who hijacked four commercial airplanes, deliberately crashing two planes against the World Trade Center towers, flying another plane into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashing into a field in Pennsylvania.\n7: The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and were orchestrated by the al-Qaida terrorist group based in Afghanistan.\n8: The attackers traveled to Afghanistan for training.\n9: The 19 hijackers included 15 from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Lebanon, and one from Egypt.\n10: The 9/11 Commission Report , published in 2004, provided a comprehensive account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the events and circumstances leading to the attacks, and recommendations to prevent other attacks.\n11: Soleimani is not named anywhere in the report.\n12: A section of the report said Iranian officials had been willing to facilitate the travel of al-Qaida members through Iran, on their way to and from Afghanistan, telling Iranian border inspectors not to stamp the passports of those travelers.\n13: (Iran and Afghanistan share a border.)\n14: The report said that Saudi \"muscle\" operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.\n15: \"Muscle\" operatives were hijackers who would storm cockpits and control passengers.\n16: But the report also said it found no evidence that Iran was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.\n17: \"At the time of their travel through Iran, the al-Qaida operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their future operation,\" the report said.\n18: So while the report mentions Iranian officials\u2019 willingness to facilitate the travel of al-Qaida members, it doesn\u2019t implicate Soleimani.\n19: Philip Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission Report, told PolitiFact that the report did not directly tie Soleimani to assisting the travel of the terrorists and that he was not aware of any other information that would tie Soleimani to their travel.\n20: Two other experts shared the view of a lacking Soleimani connection: James Gelvin, a professor of modern Middle East history at UCLA, and Hooshang Amirahmadi, a distinguished service professor at Rutgers University with expertise in United States-Iran relations.\n21: What is Pence\u2019s defense?\n22: Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman pointed out the Trump administration\u2019s April 2019 stated intention to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization.\n23: The administration in a fact-sheet said the U.S. Treasury Department in 2016 sanctioned three senior al-Qaida operatives in Iran, and that Iran had knowingly permitted those operatives, including several of the 9/11 hijackers, to transit Iran on their way to Afghanistan.\n24: But that fact-sheet does not mention Soleimani.\n25: Pence\u2019s tweet said Soleimani assisted \"10 of the 12 terrorists,\" and Twitter users pointed out that there were 19 terrorists on 9/11.\n26: Waldman tweeted , \"For those asking: 12 of the 19 transited through Afghanistan.\n27: 10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani.\"\n28: Her tweet did not provide any additional information or links to evidence to support Pence\u2019s claim.",

Gardner, an election law expert at the University at Buffalo School of Law.\n5: \"If the Electoral College were abolished, presumably the president would be elected by nationwide majority vote,\" Gardner said.\n6: In such a system, all groups of people \"would have precisely identical influence on the outcome of the election since every vote would count equally in the final tally,\" he said.\n7: A voter in Los Angeles County would have exactly the same input into the presidential election as would a voter in rural Wyoming if a national popular vote were used to elect the president, said Robert Speel, a political science associate professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College.\n8: Background on the Electoral College process Voters on Election Day choose who they want as president, yet the final vote comes later through the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors.\n9: (The candidate who reaches 270 Electoral College votes wins.)\n10: The number of electors a state gets equals the combined number of members a state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n11: Each state has two senators, and the number of representatives for each state varies depending on the state\u2019s population.\n12: States with more people have more representatives.\n13: (Though not a state, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors due to a constitutional amendment.\n14: U.S. territories, like Puerto Rico, do not get electors and cannot vote in the general election.)\n15: Eliminating the Electoral College (and not creating a new system in its place) would mean that the president is elected based on the popular vote -- that is, who gets the most votes on Election Day.\n16: Supporters of the Electoral College argue that keeping it requires candidates to get votes from all parts of the country, including less populated areas.\n17: Opponents say that it actually makes candidates focus only on swing states -- states where the margin is close enough that either party has a chance of winning.\n18: Population of Los Angeles County and 43 states The Facebook post appears to suggest that since Los Angeles County has a lot of people \u2014 an estimated 10.1 million as of July 2019 \u2014 it will outweigh the voice of 43 other states.\n19: The post doesn\u2019t specify which states, nor does it make clear if it means the county will be stronger than the 43 states combined or compared to each.\n20: U.S. Census Bureau population estimates show that 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico each had fewer people than did Los Angeles County.\n21: (Perhaps whoever created the Facebook post added the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to arrive at \"43 states.\")\n22: One way to read the post is to say that Los Angeles County\u2019s influence under a direct popular vote would outweigh the combination of all 43 states.\n23: But that\u2019s wrong.\n24: The 43 states\u2019 collective population \u2014 about 163.7 million \u2014 is about 16 times that of Los Angeles County.\n25: In a direct popular vote system, candidates might adjust their campaign strategy to appear in major media markets like Los Angeles, because that would be the most efficient use of campaign resources.\n26: \"So maybe the author is trying inartfully to say this,\" Gardner said of the Facebook post.\n27: But it\u2019s uncertain whether candidates would even make that change.\n28: It could also be that candidates avoid places like Los Angeles because they are reliably Democratic and focus instead on winning swing regions, Gardner said.\n29: Under the Electoral College system, candidates spend almost all of their general election campaign time in urban and suburban areas in 10 to 12 battleground states, Speel said.\n30: In a popular vote system, they would likely stick to those regions but in a greater variety of states, he said.\n31: \"Presidential candidates are not going to campaign for the general election in rural areas no matter what system is used, simply because there aren't enough votes there,\" Speel said.",

Steven Barnett, who co-directs the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University.\n18: Public school students take the Florida Kindergarten Readiness Screener within 30 days of entering kindergarten.\n19: The assessment test asks students to recognize numbers up to 20, distinguish numbers from letters, and match words that are the same, among other skills.\n20: The information is meant to help teachers and parents, as well as the state.\n21: The state uses the results to calculate the kindergarten readiness rates for Florida\u2019s voluntary prekindergarten program , which provides free access to all of the state\u2019s 4-year-olds.\n22: In May, results showed that 41% of children who participated in VPK were not ready for kindergarten.\n23: In response, DeSantis directed education commissioner Richard Corcoran to create an improvement plan.\n24: In the same press release , Corcoran called for \"a real accountability measure for all our school readiness programs\" and said it was a rallying cry to improve early learning.\n25: Does that mean adding tests for voluntary pre-k?\n26: We did not get a response by our deadline.\n27: So far we have not seen any more details from the DeSantis administration.\n28: For the record, Florida law already requires VPK students to take a test at the outset of the program and at the end.\n29: The assessments are designed to track progress for the students, classroom and preschool center.\n30: A new bill filed by state lawmakers would require VPK students to undergo a specified screening and progress-monitoring program.\n31: Since the session just started, we don\u2019t yet know how far proposal will go or whether DeSantis supports it.\n32: His office did not respond to our questions about that.\n33: An aide to a bill sponsor, Sen. Gayle Harrell, said that Harrell doesn\u2019t know if DeSantis supports her bill.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: Campaigning for re-election in Milwaukee, host city for the upcoming Democratic National Convention, President Donald Trump contrasted himself with President Barack Obama on fighting terrorism.\n1: The focus: Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, who was considered to be one of the most powerful and important officials in Iran.\n2: He was killed Jan. 3 in Iraq in a drone strike authorized by Trump.\n3: After detailing terrorist acts attributed to \"this son of a bitch,\" Trump said Soleimani \"wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\"\n4: Soleimani \"was a designated terrorist by President Obama, who didn't do anything about it,\" Trump charged .\n5: Trump also made the claim a week earlier to conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh.\n6: Is it true?\n7: Like President George W. Bush before him, Obama did not capture or kill Soleimani after a designation was placed him.\n8: Thousands of such official sanctionings related to terrorism are made without such actions being taken.\n9: And a series of designations, escalated under Obama, made it more difficult for Soleimani to travel and conduct financial transactions.\n10: Obama didn\u2019t take action against Soleimani beyond that.\n11: Soleimani first designated by Bush There are different levels of designations the U.S. government makes on individuals and groups related to terrorism.\n12: Soleimani was originally designated , as the government refers to it, by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2007 \u2014 under Bush \u2014 based on being commander of the Quds Force.\n13: At the same time, the Treasury designated the Quds Force for \"providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.\"\n14: In 2007, U.S. special operations forces planned a mission to capture Soleimani, but senior U.S. leaders declined to approve it, retired Army Col. Frank Sobchak told PolitiFact.\n15: Sobchak was one of the lead editors of the Army's report on the Iraq War.\n16: \"Individuals that we talked to in senior positions of the U.S. government told us that with support for the war at an all time low in 2007, the Bush administration recognized the importance of Soleimani to the war, but was not willing to risk the political capital and repercussions that could occur from expanding the war to that level,\" he said.\n17: So, the designation led to actions being weighed by Bush, but not taken.\n18: Designations under Obama The Obama administration designated Soleimani twice.\n19: The U.S. Treasury Department designated him in May 2011 for his role as the commander of the Quds Force, \"the primary conduit for Iran's support to the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate.\"\n20: The allegations had to do with Syrian protesters being killed by Syrian security forces.\n21: The more serious move came in October 2011, when Treasury designated Soleimani again, saying he oversaw the Quds Force officers who plotted an attempt to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States.\n22: The killing of the ambassador was to have taken place in a bombing at Cafe Milano in Washington, D.C., according to federal prosecutors.\n23: That is the designation Trump\u2019s campaign cited to us when we asked for information to support Trump\u2019s claim.\n24: That Treasury action made Soleimani a \"specially designated global terrorist,\" said Jacob Shapiro , professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.\n25: There are more than 4,100 people on various Treasury sanctions lists, but only about 1,600 specially designated global terrorists, he said.\n26: Americans are prohibited from engaging in transactions with individuals who are designated, and any assets they may hold in the United States are frozen.\n27: \"But just because the U.S. designates a group as a terrorist organization does not mean there is an official policy to assassinate the organization's leaders or actively target the group's members,\" said Colin Clarke , a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a global security think tank.\n28: In short, the designations made it more difficult for Soleimani to maneuver in terms of travel and conducting financial transactions, although he clearly was able to work around those restrictions, Shapiro said.\n29: When announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members.\n30: \"I am unaware of any capture or kill mission that was publicly revealed against Soleimani by the Obama administration,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu , senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us.\n31: Similarly, after Soleimani\u2019s death, Derek Chollet, assistant secretary of defense from 2012 to 2015, told the Daily Beast: \"To my knowledge, there was never a decision of \u2018We\u2019ve gotta go find this guy and get him.\u2019\" That comment was echoed by retired Gen. David Petraeus, the CIA director under Obama, on CBS\u2019 \"Face the Nation.\"\n32: It\u2019s also worth noting that because of a multination deal pushed by Obama with Iran to curb Iran\u2019s ability to make a nuclear weapon, Soleimani would eventually be removed from a United Nations sanctions list.\n33: The upshot Clearly, Obama didn\u2019t go as far as Trump did in taking action against Soleimani.\n34: Under Obama, \"a policy choice was made to reduce U.S. military presence in the Middle East and shift capabilities to the Pacific,\" said Rick Brennan , a career Army officer and political scientist at the RAND Corp. \"At the same time, the administration was focused on gaining Iranian agreement to the Iran nuclear deal and elected not to press Iran on its regional terrorist activities conducted by the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force) and General Soleimani, even though the IRGC-QF was becoming more and more active in places such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.\n35: \"So, President Trump was correct in stating that the Obama administration did nothing that had a detrimental impact on General Soleimani or the IRGC-QF.\"\n36: But it goes too far to say that Obama didn\u2019t do anything, given that the designations themselves carried some force \u2014 for example, restricting Soleimani\u2019s ability to travel and finance his operations.\n37: \"The sanctions reflect the fact that the Obama administration took a number of steps \u2014 some seen many others unseen \u2014 to constrain Soleimani\u2019s activities,\" said Ned Price , who served as special assistant to Obama for national security affairs and was referred to us by an Obama spokesman.\n38: From 2011 on, Price argued, American service members and diplomats in Iraq were not attacked by Iranian proxies and militias as they have been since May 2018, when Trump implemented his maximum pressure strategy on Iran.\n39: In short, said Alex Vatanka , a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute: \"Designating entities and individuals in Iran are all meant to press Iran to change its ways, policies.\n40: So, they weren\u2019t necessarily meant to be an end in itself.\"",

Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca.\n18: King said he recalled al-Baghdadi leaving in 2009 and saying, \"I\u2019ll see you guys in New York.\"\n19: King later told ABC News he \"could be mistaken\" and that al-Baghdadi\u2019s \"face is very familiar.\"\n20: A U.S.-Iraq agreement did drive the transfer of many detainees to Iraq in 2009, but that framework was set up by President George W. Bush in 2008.\n21: The Defense Department said al-Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody in 2009.\n22: And an article in the Guardian quoted another ISIS commander talking about meeting al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2004.\n23: The article said he was transferred because officials saw nothing of concern.\n24: We also found no evidence that Obama, then an Illinois state senator who had just won election to the Senate, said al-Baghdadi was \"low risk\" when he was released in 2004 \u2014 or ever.\n25: The Obama administration designated al-Baghdadi a global terrorist in a 2011 federal notice .",

Company,' Similar to Hunter Biden,\" reads a headline on the website founded by conservative radio host Wayne Dupree on Oct. 4, 2019.\n3: The story asserts the following: The Democrats are treating the Ukraine like \"Ziprecruiter.com\" for their lazy, do-nothing privileged kids.\n4: A new report out reveals that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s son Paul Pelosi also worked as an exec at a gas company with strong ties to the Ukraine, similar to Hunter Biden.\n5: How deep does the Dem/Ukraine corruption go, for crying out loud?\n6: We\u2019re going to need bigger shovels to dig through this never-ending mess.\n7: The bombshell report reveals that Paul Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine in 2017 to meet with government officials in regards to a business initiative.\n8: In recently unearthed records, we now know that Paul Pelosi Jr. was an executive of a gas industry company that did a lot of business in Ukraine \u2013 a lot \u2013 and his mother Nancy Pelosi was even featured in one of the company\u2019s promotional videos.\n9: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n10: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n11: We previously fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be incorrect.\n12: Here too, we found no evidence that Pelosi Jr. served as an executive for a Ukraine-based gas company.\n13: What we found \u2022 The situation is not similar to Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment to the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.\n14: \u2022 Paul Pelosi Jr. once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil.\n15: After he left the board, the company dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name.\n16: \u2022 Pelosi Jr. had no part in the new entity, which is not is not based in Ukraine.\n17: It\u2019s unclear to what extent the company has done any business in Ukraine.\n18: WayneDupree.com did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\n19: Position with Viscoil The source appears to be an Oct. 3 tweet from Patrick Howley, a conservative writer who publishes material at the website nationalfile.com .\n20: \"BOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE!\"\n21: Howley said in the tweet, which has been retweeted almost 14,000 times.\n22: \"And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!\"\n23: As evidence, Howley linked to two YouTube videos published March 5, 2013.\n24: The first shows Paul Pelosi Jr. speaking at an event in Washington.\n25: The video opens with clips of a speech from Nancy Pelosi and then shows Paul at an XPRIZE Foundation competition in September 2010.\n26: The nonprofit group organizes public competitions with businesses to encourage their technological development.\n27: RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place \"My name\u2019s Paul Pelosi, of course I\u2019m on the board of Viscoil, and Viscoil\u2019s here today to talk about accelerating the future,\" he says during the video.\n28: Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010.\n29: An old version of the company's website said the company was created to \"engage in research and in the commercial development of hydrocarbon production methods and technologies.\"\n30: After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into NRGLab, a Singapore-based company \"specializing in different areas of scientific research.\"\n31: It appears to have published the YouTube videos.\n32: The second video Howley posted shows Walter Afanasieff, a Brazilian-American musician, talking about how technology could improve oil extraction.\n33: The caption lists other artists that had promoted Viscoil\u2019s work, including Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer and actress.\n34: \"Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,\" the caption reads.\n35: An SH-box is a kind of environmentally friendly generator, according to NRGLab .\n36: We found a Facebook page on which Newton has promoted NRGLab\u2019s work, but we could find no news coverage about the company's dealings in Ukraine.\n37: NRGLab does not mention the country on its website.\n38: We reached out to the company for more information but did not get a response.\n39: Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact last year that Paul Pelosi Jr. worked for Viscoil for a short time.\n40: He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine when he was working for the company.\n41: \"The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,\" he told PolitiFact in an email.\n42: \"The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\"\n43: The timeline Hammill offered fits the evidence we\u2019ve seen.\n44: Soccer in Ukraine In addition, the WayneDupree.com article cited a TV appearance Pelosi Jr. made on Ukrainian television in 2017 .\n45: But while Pelosi was indeed in Ukraine at the time, there is no evidence to support that he was there while working as an executive for a Ukraine-based gas company.\n46: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Paul Pelosi Jr. appears on Ukrainian television in 2017 For starters, the TV interview did not mention anything about energy or gas companies.\n47: On the Ukrainian show, Pelosi Jr. said that it was his first visit to Kyiv, and it involved his employment as executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative , specifically a partnership on youth soccer involving the World Sports Alliance and the Ukrainian government.\n48: The Corporate Governance Initiative says its mission is to help organizations \"adhere to a system of guidelines, practices, and procedures by which a company is directed and controlled.\"\n49: Pelosi Jr.\u2019s mention of the World Sports Alliance came about two years before one of its top executives, Asa Saint Clair, was indicted in November 2019 for using the \"World Sports Alliance, a sham affiliate of the United Nations, as a vehicle to defraud lenders\" through a cryptocurrency scheme, according to the Justice Department.\n50: In a 2016 news release , Saint Clair touted the Corporate Governance Institute\u2019s governance principles and described Pelosi Jr. as \"a longtime associate, both business and personal.\"\n51: Pelosi Jr. is quoted at length in the news release.\n52: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office confirmed that at the time of the Ukraine trip, Pelosi Jr. was working for the Corporate Governance Institute, and that the connection to the World Sports Alliance came from the alliance\u2019s endorsement of the institute\u2019s corporate governance principles.\n53: Her office said that Pelosi Jr. did not do any work for the World Sports Alliance and was not paid by them.\n54: None of this changes the claim in the headline \u2014 that \"Nancy Pelosi's Son Paul Jr. Was Exec at 'Ukraine-Based Gas Company,' Similar to Hunter Biden.\"",

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., often stresses her Texas ties, peppering her public speeches, social media posts and debate remarks with references to her experience as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, a law student at the University of Texas at Austin and later as a law professor back in Houston and Austin.\n1: One anecdote in particular has become a frequent refrain for the Democratic presidential candidate: When she attended the University of Houston, her tuition was $50 a semester.\n2: She repeated this claim during a town hall event in Iowa in January, as she described how she became a teacher.\n3: \"So, here's how my story goes,\" Warren says.\n4: \"I was a high school debater and I got a scholarship to college \u2014 woo hoo.\n5: And then, at 19, I fell in love, got married and dropped out \u2014 woo hoo.\n6: Now, a good life, a life I had chosen.\n7: But I thought that was it and I\u2019d lost out on the chance to be a public school teacher.\n8: I thought I gave that up.\n9: \"We were living outside of Houston and that\u2019s when I found it.\n10: A commuter college, 45 minutes away that cost $50 a semester.\n11: For a price I could pay with a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma, I became a special education teacher.\n12: I lived my dream job.\"\n13: Warren did not explicitly reference the University of Houston, but she has named the school multiple times in other versions of the same statement.\n14: \"It's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston,\" she said in an October tweet.\n15: Today, tuition at the University of Houston costs about $4,000 per semester for an undergraduate student taking 12 hours.\n16: Is it true that Warren paid $50 when she attended the same school?\n17: Tuition versus total cost University records show that tuition for Texas residents taking a full course load while Warren was enrolled was $50, but additional fees brought the total cost of attending the school up to about $100 a semester.\n18: Chris Hayden, spokesman for Warren\u2019s campaign, said it was clear her claim was referencing tuition and not associated expenses.\n19: He highlighted multiple occasions when Warren specified that she was talking just about tuition.\n20: In Warren\u2019s 2014 memoir titled \"A Fighting Chance,\" she discussed paying for her education.\n21: \"The University of Houston was about forty minutes away, and tuition was only $50 a semester,\" she wrote.\n22: The $50 amount also makes an appearance in a Medium post by Warren outlining her proposal for universal free public college, posted in April 2019.\n23: \"I thought my dream of teaching was over,\" she said in the post.\n24: \"But then a friend told me about the University of Houston, a public four-year college about 40 minutes away.\n25: We were a young couple, watching every nickel.\n26: I figured I couldn\u2019t afford it.\n27: But it turned out that tuition was just $50 a semester.\"\n28: University bulletins show tuition, fees for students Warren graduated from the University of Houston in 1970, according to a copy of her curriculum vitae.\n29: At PolitiFact\u2019s request, the University of Houston provided university bulletins detailing information such as tuition and fees for four\u00a0academic years around the time of Warren\u2019s graduation: 1966-67, 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71.\n30: Across the four academic years, the tuition varies based on a student\u2019s residency (Texas residents pay less in tuition) and the number of hours a student registers for each semester.\n31: For Texas residents taking 12 or more hours, the maximum amount listed, tuition during all three academic years was $50 a semester.\n32: But there were other expenses students enrolled at the university during those years were required to pay each semester, including a Student Services fee, a University Center fee and an Academic Building Use fee.\n33: Warren describes the university as a commuter college, implying that she lived at home and traveled back and forth to campus to attend her classes, which would negate costs associated with room and board.\n34: During the 1966-67 academic year, when Warren likely started at the university, tuition was $50 a semester and the other fees were about $39, assuming Warren took a full course load and only during fall and spring semesters.\n35: That brings Warren\u2019s grand total to $89 a semester, which doesn\u2019t include the cost of books or other school supplies.\n36: During the 1968-69 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $41.\n37: That brings Warren\u2019s grand total to $91 a semester, again excluding the cost of books or other school supplies.\n38: During the 1969-70 academic year, tuition was $50 a semester and other fees totaled $55.\n39: That brings Warren\u2019s grand total to $105 a semester.\n40: Warren was not enrolled at the university during the 1970-71 school year, but tuition and fees per semester that year totaled $108 for Texas residents.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: During a recent podcast interview, Marie Newman used a question about a common transportation problem that rankles drivers to take a jab at her opponent, U.S. Representative Dan Lipinski.\n1: Newman is challenging Lipinski to a rematch for Illinois\u2019 3rd District seat in this year's Democratic primary.\n2: He clinched a narrow victory over her in 2018.\n3: Asked at a canvassing event hosted by Indivisible Chicago what she would say to constituents frustrated by trains blocking their way on the road, Newman said , \"it actually used to be a law that idling trains were not allowed.\n4: You could only idle for a very short period of time.That was lifted right around the time that Dan Lipinski came into office and he did have a part in that.\"\n5: \"Right now it stops first responders from getting to where they need to go, so that\u2019s a big problem,\" Newman added.\n6: \"People die because of it.\n7: What goes out in terms of toxic emissions into our environment is horrifying.\"\n8: That\u2019s a lot to pin on Lipinski.\n9: So we decided to find out whether the eight-term congressman, who entered office in 2005 and currently sits on the House transportation committee, played a role in the law\u2019s demise.\n10: The bottom line: He wasn\u2019t involved in any way.\n11: A judicial \u2014 not legislative \u2014 decision The federal government places no limit on how long trains can block crossings, but a 1999 Illinois law formerly allowed local municipalities to fine trains that had come to a stop and blocked a crossing for more than 10 minutes unless the train could not be moved for reasons beyond the rail carrier\u2019s control.\n12: The law was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2008 after the justices found it incompatible with federal regulations on train speed and air-brake testing.\n13: That begs the question how Lipinski, a congressman, could have played a part in putting the brakes on a state legal matter settled in court.\n14: When we reached out to Newman\u2019s campaign for an answer, spokesman Ben Hardin confirmed that was the law his candidate was referencing and acknowledged Lipinski had no involvement in the outcome of the case.\n15: Nevertheless, Hardin contended, Lipinski \"has certainly taken part in protecting corporate interests in rail over the best interests of his constituents\" in other ways, such as his role in delaying the deadline by which rail companies are required to implement technology designed to automatically slow or stop speeding trains that experts say could save lives .\n16: While that may have been a persuasive argument to some of Newman\u2019s potential constituents, it was not one she leveraged while attacking her opponent\u2019s transportation record at the Indivisible Chicago event.\n17: What\u2019s more, Lipinski has been vocal in his support for addressing the issue of idling trains.\n18: In 2016 , he wrote a letter to a federal board charged with regulating freight trains asking it to re-examine whether an operator was following an agreement it had made to not block crossings when its purchase of the line received federal approval.\n19: And last year , he raised the subject of blocked crossings with the Federal Railroad Administration, highlighting a government study that found average train length had increased 25% since 2008.\n20: \"While I understand the economic benefits of longer trains, those cannot be at the expense of community safety and quality of life for commuters,\" Lipinski stated in a July press release .\n21: Meanwhile, a recent Bloomberg report found railroad companies have successfully sued six other states in addition to Illinois for enacting laws aimed at unsnarling blocked crossings, including neighboring Indiana and Michigan along with Kansas, Oregon and Texas, which are also home to major freight hubs .",

        "passage": "0: One of the biggest political stories of the year in 2019 occurred on Sept. 11.\n1: Democratic Gov.\n2: Roy Cooper had vetoed the GOP-controlled legislature\u2019s budget proposal.\n3: On most days, Republicans in the legislature have enough votes for a simple majority \u2014 but not the supermajority needed to override a veto.\n4: But on the morning of Sept. 11, many Democrats were absent.\n5: So House Speaker Tim Moore called a vote and the veto override passed.\n6: This is where Rep. Deb Butler comes in.\n7: The Wilmington Democrat gained recognition for trying to stop the vote, which she considered improper.\n8: (She famously yelled \"I will not yield\" and \"shame on you, Mr. Speaker\" while on the vote was happening.)\n9: Fast forward to January, when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene.\n10: In a Jan. 5 tweet , Butler said she\u2019s calling on Senate leader Phil Berger \"who expressed disdain for the ambush vote in the House\" to negotiate with Cooper rather than try to override his veto.\n11: Berger, like Speaker Moore, is a Republican.\n12: It\u2019s uncommon for the two Republican leaders to publicly criticize each other.\n13: So we wondered whether Butler was right.\n14: Did Berger \"express disdain\" for how Moore executed the veto override?\n15: Lack of evidence We asked Butler where she saw or heard Berger\u2019s supposed disdain.\n16: \"I can\u2019t remember exactly where I read it, but it was in the context of the Senate rules requiring 24 hours notice of a veto override vote and then he said something to the effect that, besides he didn\u2019t like the approach used by the Speaker,\" Butler said.\n17: \"I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember precisely where.\"\n18: We also reached out to Berger\u2019s office and asked whether Berger holds disdain for how the House overrode Cooper\u2019s veto, or whether he ever expressed negative feelings about how it happened.\n19: \"I'm not aware of him ever saying anything like that,\" Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said.\n20: PolitiFact and WRAL reporters could find no specific examples of Berger saying anything negative about the House budget override.\n21: A press conference The closest Berger came to criticizing Moore and the House was during an Oct. 1 press conference.\n22: Even then, he didn\u2019t mention Moore specifically or say the House did anything wrong.\n23: WRAL recorded the press conference.\n24: Around the 2:30 mark of the video , Berger talked about his preference for finding a budget solution.\n25: \"I\u2019d rather have a broad, bipartisan vote \u2014 just like you saw on redistricting \u2014 than a veto override that squeaks through,\" Berger said.\n26: Then, around the 3:40 mark of the video, Berger explains the logistics of how the Senate must conduct a veto override vote.\n27: \"Before I take your questions, I\u2019ll answer what\u2019s probably at least one of the questions, maybe the top question: Senate rules require 24 hours\u2019 notice before calendaring a veto override.\n28: We will adhere to the rules,\" Berger said.\n29: \"I\u2019ll be glad to take your questions.\"\n30: Berger also said he\u2019d seize an opportunity to pass the budget.\n31: If could be argued that promise alone proves he didn\u2019t show disdain for the House vote.\n32: To disdain something means to feel like it\u2019s \"not good enough to deserve your respect or attention,\" according to the Oxford dictionary .\n33: Merriam-Webster says it means to treat something as \"beneath one\u2019s notice or dignity.\"",

        "passage": "0: A few days before a holiday celebrating his life, conspiracies about Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death are circulating on Instagram.\n1: In an image reposted Jan. 14 from another account, a brand called Olmecian Clothing claimed that, contrary to popular belief, King did not die from a gunshot wound.\n2: The post includes a photo of what appears to be King in a hospital bed.\n3: \"He was killed (smothered) in the hospital,\" the post reads.\n4: \"Also in 1999 the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him but was silenced by the media.\"\n5: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook , which owns Instagram.)\n7: It has more than 9,700 likes, and similar posts were shared on Facebook.\n8: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A popular Instagram and Facebook post claims Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in the hospital after he was shot.\n9: We rate the posts False.\n10: (Screenshot from Instagram) We checked Congress\u2019 report on King\u2019s death, as well as the book and lawsuit cited in the Instagram post.\n11: None of them provide evidence that the civil rights leader was killed in a government plot \u2014\u00a0and the photo itself does not show King after he was shot.\n12: King died from gunshot wound The most authoritative report on King\u2019s assassination is a congressional report from 1979.\n13: It said he died from a gunshot wound.\n14: According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations\u2019 report, King was shot shortly after 6 p.m. on April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n15: He was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. at St. Joseph Hospital.\n16: An autopsy conducted at Gaston Hospital determined that King\u2019s cause of death was a \"gunshot wound to the chin and neck with a total transaction of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord and other structures of the neck.\"\n17: A convicted armed robber and escaped prison inmate named James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of King on March 10, 1969.\n18: (He recanted his confession days later but was never able to formally withdraw his guilty plea.)\n19: Critics questioned the thoroughness of the autopsy report, but a panel of three forensic pathologists commissioned by the House committee concluded that the findings were generally accurate.\n20: They reached that conclusion after reviewing \"the report of the committee's firearms panel, as well as X-rays, medical reports, notes, and documents submitted by physicians who treated Dr.\n21: King.\"\n22: A decades-old conspiracy theory The conspiracy that King was killed by someone at the hospital stems from an attorney who represented Ray.\n23: The post\u2019s caption cites a 2016 book by the lawyer, William Pepper, titled \"The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\" Moor Information, the Instagram account from which Olmecian Clothing reposted the image, conceded in its caption that the book \"has never been verified.\"\n24: Pepper represented Ray during the tail-end of his trial for King\u2019s murder and has spent years trying to prove his innocence.\n25: Ray died in prison in 1998. Pepper claims in the book that Ray didn\u2019t kill King \u2014\u00a0instead, he was framed by U.S. government agencies.\n26: RELATED: Claims about MLK often go astray \"The plan, according to Pepper, was for a team of United States Army Special Forces snipers to kill King, but just as they were taking aim, a backup civilian assassin pulled the trigger,\" reads the book\u2019s description.\n27: There is no direct evidence that happened.\n28: Hampton Sides, author of \"Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His \u00adAssassin,\" told Time magazine in April 2018 that the source of many conspiracies about King\u2019s death can be traced to Ray\u2019s guilty plea, which stopped his trial from proceeding.\n29: \"There was a huge amount of evidence presented in Memphis that didn\u2019t see the light of day in a public forum,\" Sides said.\n30: \"I think that contributed to the sense of conspiracy, like a \u2018What are they hiding?\u2019 kind of thing.\"\n31: Those conspiracies are also fueled by the fact that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spied on King during the 1960s.\n32: Pepper has been active in other conspiracy movements, such as those that doubt official accounts of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n33: As for the actual photo in the Instagram post, it doesn\u2019t show King at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis.\n34: It depicts King after he was stabbed on Sept. 20, 1958, in New York City.\n35: Civil suit doesn\u2019t prove conspiracy As additional evidence for its claim that King was killed in a nefarious government plot, the Instagram post cited a 1999 lawsuit.\n36: But the case doesn\u2019t show what Olmecian Clothing says it does.\n37: King vs. Jowers was a wrongful death civil suit filed by Pepper on behalf of King\u2019s wife and children.\n38: The unlikely partnership was a result of the family\u2019s belief that Pepper\u2019s version of the assassination got at the real truth behind King\u2019s death, according to the New York Times .\n39: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In this April 8, 1968 file photo, Coretta Scott King, third right, is accompanied by her children, Yolanda, Bernice, Martin III, and Dexter at Sisters Chapel on the campus of Spelman College in Atlanta.\n40: (AP) Loyd Jowers was a Memphis cafe owner who claimed he hired someone other than Ray to assassinate King.\n41: A prosecutor who investigated King\u2019s assassination said several of Jowers\u2019 associates said he hoped to get a movie or book deal.\n42: The jury issued a verdict that said Jowers and \"others, including government agencies\" were part of a conspiracy to assassinate King.\n43: The jury awarded the Kings the $100 in damages that they sought.\n44: But in a 2000 review of the lawsuit, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict.\n45: (It\u2019s worth noting that civil suits only require plaintiffs to prove their case by a \"preponderance of the evidence\" instead of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is a more stringent burden of proof that\u2019s used in criminal court.)\n46: \"Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,\" the Justice Department wrote in its report on King vs. Jowers.\n47: \"Additionally, none of these allegations were ever linked together.\"",

about California\u2019s water conservation laws recently resurfaced after a guest on a Los Angeles TV station shared misinformation on air.\n2: \"Starting Jan. 1 California residents can\u2019t take shower, do laundry, poop in toilet and flush on same day,\" said one Facebook post that drew thousands of views to the segment, which was broadcast Dec. 31 on KTLA.\n3: \"No really!\n4: This is not satire.\n5: 55 Gallons per person!\"\n6: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n7: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n8: We debunked the same bogus information about California\u2019s conservation efforts in 2018, shortly after then-California Gov.\n9: Jerry Brown signed two water-use bills into law.\n10: Now, as the misinformation makes a resurgence, we wanted to set the record straight: It was never illegal for Californians to shower and wash laundry on the same day.\n11: It still isn\u2019t.\n12: Old hoax, new outrage The renewed controversy came after KTLA, a local TV station, ran a segment on Dec. 31 about \"unusual and underreported\" California laws taking effect in 2020.\n13: The network welcomed Southern California lawyer Richard Lee on the show, and an anchor teed up a discussion of two California water laws that Lee said would apply in 2020.\n14: Lee\u2019s response parroted many of the inaccurate claims we looked at in 2018.\n15: \"Doing a load of laundry takes about 40 to 50 gallons of water,\" Lee said.\n16: \"Taking a shower for about eight minutes takes about 17 gallons of water.\"\n17: \"Well, there\u2019s a limitation on your daily use of water of 55 gallons per day,\" he continued.\n18: \"So that means, if you are taking a shower and if you\u2019re doing a load of laundry, you can\u2019t do both without being in violation of the law.\"\n19: Lee went on to say that violators would be fined \"$1,000 per each day that you are in violation,\" and more during drought conditions, starting Jan. 1, 2020.\n20: \"Wow,\" KTLA Morning News anchor Mark Kriski said.\n21: \"So all of a sudden, I can smoke marijuana as much as I want, but I can\u2019t take a shower.\n22: Unbelievable.\"\n23: Claims that the laws ban showering and laundry on the same day are False .\n24: We fact-checked them when they first circulated in 2018.\n25: So did Snopes and a number of local news outlets .\n26: KTLA replaced the clip on its website with a correction noting that the segment \"included factual errors about two laws going into effect in 2020 regarding water conservation.\"\n27: But that effort didn\u2019t stop the video from spreading to all corners of social media and making headlines on conservative sites such as American Lookout and the Gateway Pundit .\n28: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The misinformation spread so far and so fast that the California Department of Water Resources and the Association of California Water Agencies both issued statements debunking it.\n29: A representative from KTLA declined to comment, but Lee told us that \"the segment was intended to simply be a quick rundown that each person in California could and should be more mindful on his or her indoor water usage.\"\n30: \"I was simply stating that 55 gallons per day is the standard for per capita indoor water usage per day set forth by the state legislature,\" he said.\n31: \"Those fines are to the water agency or provider.\n32: That said, there is the question of whether a water agency or provider would pass along this fine to the individual consumer.\"\n33: Individuals don\u2019t have to worry about fines The false claims about California water use center on two bills \u2014 Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 \u2014 that Brown, the state\u2019s former governor, signed into law on May 31, 2018, as California was reeling from a five-year drought that ended in 2017.\n34: Broadly speaking, the laws instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets.\n35: But the new water limits \u2014 which kick in starting in 2023, not 2020 \u2014 won\u2019t target individuals.\n36: The legislation requires cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts to come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022.\n37: They will need to meet these targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.\n38: George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by a few standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use \u2014 a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030.\n39: \"These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal,\" Kostyrko said.\n40: \"There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry,\" added Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668.\n41: In sum, fines based on consumption will be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their goals, not to individuals who use too much water in their daily lives.\n42: Of course, water districts could theoretically shift those costs to individual water bills.\n43: But no resident will be fined $1,000 for doing laundry and showering on a normal day.\n44: Senate Bill 606 does give water agencies the ability to fine some individual lawbreakers, the Sacramento Bee noted.\n45: But that\u2019s only when they violate local water-use limits during an official \"water shortage emergency\" that threatens \"human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.\"",

        "passage": "0: As the U.S. Senate begins its trial of President Donald Trump, based on impeachment articles approved by the House, congressional Republicans have blasted Democrats for what they say was an attempt to remove him from office long before the official Dec. 18, 2019 vote.\n1: In a Dec. 20, 2019 appearance on WTMJ radio\u2019s Steve Scaffidi Show, U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher added his voice to the fray.\n2: Gallagher, R-Wis., argued that the \"common-sense Wisconsinite\" would rather resolve Trump\u2019s future at the ballot box come November.\n3: Gallagher, elected in 2016, represents the 8th District, which includes the Fox Valley and Green Bay.\n4: \"Isn\u2019t this the third impeachment vote you\u2019ve had in the House?\n5: Which it is,\" Gallagher told Scaffidi.\n6: \"They tried to impeach Trump for criticizing the NFL and for some other things.\"\n7: Is Gallagher right?\n8: And how does football fit in?\n9: Let\u2019s break it down.\n10: Falling back on old votes When asked to provide evidence for Gallagher\u2019s claim, his press secretary Jordan Dunn pointed to the same three House roll call votes that Gallagher\u2019s colleague from southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, used to make a claim about impeachment about a week earlier.\n11: Each of the votes overwhelmingly tabled impeachment resolutions offered by U.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.\n12: The first vote took place Dec. 6, 2017, the second Jan. 18, 2018, and the third July 17, 2019 \u2014 days before the Ukraine call that triggered the official impeachment inquiry.\n13: Like Sensenbrenner, Gallagher\u2019s office claimed that lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the motion to table the impeachment measure were actually casting a \"yes\" vote on impeachment.\n14: But, as we reported before, experts told us those two actions can\u2019t be conflated.\n15: \"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email.\n16: \"It is not technically a direct vote on the substance of the resolution.\"\n17: Thus, there never was a vote on the merits of any of Green\u2019s measures.\n18: Though one can surely argue at least some Democrats were convinced Trump had committed impeachable offenses before the Ukraine call, no one cast an \"impeachment vote\" until Dec. 18.\n19: That\u2019s when Trump was impeached over allegations he withheld aid to Ukraine and asked the country to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n20: So Gallagher is off point on the first part of the claim.\n21: Impeachment and NFL criticism What about the idea Democrats wanted to impeach Trump for criticizing the NFL?\n22: The text of Green\u2019s 2017 resolution references a statement in which Trump took aim at professional football players \u2014 following the lead of former quarterback Colin Kapernick \u2014 who had begun to kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.\n23: At a Sept. 23, 2017 campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., the president said :\u00a0 \"Wouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired?\n24: He\u2019s fired!\u2019\" But Green\u2019s resolution admonished Trump for \"inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of race and gender,\" not for chastising the football league itself.\n25: Indeed, in May 2018, when the NFL released a policy warning that players who protested during the national anthem would face consequences, Trump commended the league.\n26: Moreover, that paragraph was just one of 11 instances Green cited as examples of why the president should be impeached.\n27: Others included Trump\u2019s referring to members of hate groups that marched in Charlottesville, Va/, in 2017 as \"very fine people,\" his call for a complete ban on Muslims entering the U.S., banning transgender people from serving in the military, arguing that the federal government gave too much help to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and issuing several disparaging statements about U.S. Rep Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, who is African American.\n28: To claim that some representatives wanted Trump impeached solely over NFL criticism is a mischaracterization of the facts.",

John Rodgers made national news last week when he introduced a bill that would ban cellphones for Vermonters under the age of 21.\n1: It\u2019s not a proposal that Rodgers necessarily supports, but it met his goal of starting a conversation about the lengths we are willing to go to protect children.\n2: To drive home his point that the gun control bills are as much a waste of time as his cellphone bill, Rodgers made the claim \u2014 on many occasions over the past week \u2014 that while people are worrying about the dangers of gun violence in Vermont, they are ignoring something far more dangerous: cellphones.\n3: \"Cellphones are far more dangerous than guns are,\" Rodgers said in an interview with VTDigger last week.\n4: \"No gun has ever been used to radicalize or recruit terrorists, neo-Nazis or fascists.\n5: And the number one killer of teens in the United States is driving while using cellphones.\"\n6: In emails from his Senate account, Rodgers has doubled down on this point.\n7: \"Is it a stunt when I have people around the country talking about the number one killer of teens in America,\" he asked one constituent critical of his cellphone ban proposal.\n8: He wrote to another angry emailer : \"So you are not concerned with the number one killer of teens in the country.\n9: You clueless f - - k!\"\n10: It\u2019s fair to say Rodgers has been falling back on the claim often as he defends himself from cellphone ban blowback.\n11: But is he right?\n12: An important clarification We asked Rodgers where he got his stats.\n13: He quickly walked back his original claim.\n14: \"I realize that I have framed that poorly in stating several times that the cell phone use it\u2019s self is the cause when in fact it is a major contributor but not responsible for all accidents,\" Rodgers wrote in an email.\n15: He\u2019s onto something there.\n16: It\u2019s true that the leading cause of teen deaths in the U.S. is motor vehicle accidents.\n17: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that per mile driven, drivers aged 16 to 19 are three times more likely than drivers 20 and older to be in a fatal crash.\n18: In 2015, motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death among \"children\" 8-15, \"youth\" 15-20, and \"young adults\" 21-24, according to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n19: Suicide was second on the list.\n20: That means that even including teenagers too young to drive, Rodgers\u2019 idea that motor vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death among teenagers in the United States still holds true.\n21: But that\u2019s where the truth in Rodgers\u2019 statement ends.\n22: Cellphones are just one factor For Rodgers\u2019 claim to be true, an overwhelming majority of teenage motor vehicle deaths would have to have been caused by cellphone use, so much so that it would still outnumber deaths caused by suicide (which account for roughly 1,000 fewer teen deaths than car crashes per year).\n23: However, texting comes nowhere close to topping the CDC\u2019s list of the leading causes of teen crashes.\n24: Driver inexperience takes first place, followed by driving with teen passengers, nighttime driving, and not using seat belts.\n25: Distracted driving (the category that texting while driving falls into) came in fifth.\n26: Further calling Rodgers\u2019 claim into doubt, cellphone use isn\u2019t even the leading cause of distracted driving.\n27: The most recent data available shows that in 2017, 271 teenagers died because of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n28: Of those fatalities, only 23% \u2014 or 63 teen deaths \u2014 were caused by cellphones.\n29: There were approximately 2,500 deaths by suicide among people aged 15-19, by comparison.",

William Blount in 1799 \u2014 the first impeachment in U.S. history \u2014 stopped before trial when the Senate determined it didn\u2019t have such jurisdiction over one of its own.\n15: That leaves 13 impeachment trials against other federal officials dating back to 1804.\n16: Eight of those yielded a guilty verdict, and five a not-guilty finding.\n17: But all of them involved witnesses, said Noah Bookbinder , executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n18: \"I think there was a little bit of a sense \u2014 as there often is with things like Senate procedure \u2014 that the precedent is ambiguous and can be used however you want it,\" Bookbinder told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n19: \"We found that it\u2019s not ambiguous in this case.\n20: \u2026 Every Senate impeachment trial that has been completed has involved witnesses.\"\n21: Lawyers and researchers from the organization dug through Congressional archives and historical records for every impeachment for Bookbinder\u2019s Jan. 9, 2020, op-ed in the Washington Post.\n22: His group is a nonpartisan, nonprofit watchdog that seeks to promote ethics in government and reduce the influence of money in politics.\n23: Asked for evidence of Baldwin\u2019s claim, her staff simply pointed to the Washington Post rundown.\n24: Bookbinder\u2019s piece also noted three recent trials have involved witnesses not called during the House phase of the impeachment proceedings: Judge Walter Nixon in 1989, Clinton and Judge Thomas Porteous in 2010.\n25: The piece said in part: \"Although at least one senator has suggested that the Senate has no duty to go beyond testimony obtained by the House, that has happened on multiple occasions.\n26: The Senate heard from seven witnesses at Walter Nixon\u2019s trial who had not testified before the House; three at Clinton\u2019s trial who also had not testified before the House; and 17 at Porteous\u2019s trial who had not testified before the House.\"",

Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, were kept out of the hearings not because of their party affiliation, but because they did not sit not on the relevant committees.\n17: (Democrats who weren\u2019t on the committees were kept out as well.)\n18: Some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, chose not to attend despite being able to do so.\n19: The proof is also in the transcripts that were publicly released: Republican lawmakers and staff asked questions of witnesses, with the witness responding under oath.\n20: One analysis by Philip Bump of the Washington Post found that Republican lawmakers made extensive use of their questioning powers in the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a member of the National Security Council.\n21: He did this by tallying up the number of lines devoted to each party\u2019s remarks in the transcript that was eventually released .\n22: \"About 44% of the transcript is made up of questions or answers from Democratic members or staff,\" Bump wrote.\n23: \"About 41% is from the Republicans.\n24: The remaining 15% was discussion and objections.\"\n25: Neither the White House nor Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign replied to our query asking for evidence that backed Cipollone\u2019s claim.",

        "passage": "0: With income inequality a persistent hot topic in the\u00a0Democratic presidential primary, it\u2019s not surprising that a familiar meme is circulating on Facebook claiming that Congress is far richer than the public.\n1: The Facebook post says that 50% of Congress is made up of millionaires, compared with only 1% of America as a whole.\n2: Similar Facebook posts have circulated at least since 2011 , but we wanted to find more current numbers.\n3: Unlike many of the statements we fact-check on Facebook, this one has some truth to it.\n4: A key analysis showed that close to half of the House and Senate members are millionaires.\n5: We couldn\u2019t find a source that said 1% of the American public are millionaires, but we do know that it\u2019s far less than in Congress.\n6: The post was recently flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n7: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n8: Many members of Congress are millionaires The Facebook post says: \"Let that sink in and tell me again how you become a multi millionaire earning $174,000 annually?\"\n9: That is the salary for members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, with leadership positions paying slightly more.\n10: But many members were wealthy before they arrived.\n11: The Center for Responsive Politics compiles financial disclosures of members of Congress.\n12: Those disclosure forms do not require exact values so the reports show the value of assets and liabilities within a range.\n13: The intent of the disclosures is to highlight potential conflicts of interest, not give a complete accounting of a member\u2019s personal valuation, according to the center.\n14: The center\u2019s data for 2016 shows the members\u2019 financial data in three categories: minimum net worth, average and maximum net worth.\n15: If we use the average net worth category for the House and Senate , it showed about 48% have worths of at least $1 million.\n16: The richest member was then- U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif .\n17: who had a net wealth of about $324 million and made much of his wealth from a car alarm company .\n18: Roll Call analyzed 530 members by their by their minimum net worths.\n19: By that measurement, there are 207 who are worth at least $1 million.\n20: That method results in about 39% of the members being millionaires.\n21: Sorting out the number of Americans who are millionaires It\u2019s clear that the wealth of Congress is disproportionate to the general public, but by how much?\n22: According to the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve Board, 12% of family economic units had $1 million or more of net wealth (all assets minus all debts), said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n23: A family economic unit consists of the heads of the families and dependents who live with them.\n24: We found some other analyses about how many Americans are millionaires, but none were the 1% cited in the Facebook post.\n25: Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Report showed that there are approximately 18.6 million Americans with a net worth in excess of $1 million, which works out to about 8% of the adult population.\n26: Spectrem Group found that in 2018, there were 11.8 million American households with a net worth of at least $1 million.\n27: That works out to about 5% of the adult population.\n28: The market research firm quantifies millionaire households by net worth, not including primary residence.\n29: It\u2019s possible that when the Facebook post said that 1% of people are millionaires, it was referring to annual income, which is different than net wealth.\n30: Net worth includes a person\u2019s cash, home value, stocks, bonds and other property minus any debts owed.\n31: But if we used income as the benchmark, the calculation for Congress would be different.\n32: The House and Senate members don\u2019t earn $1 million in their salary, but some earn investment income.\n33: For the population as a whole, IRS data for 2017 showed about 500,000 tax returns had incomes of at least $1 million.\n34: There were about 104 million tax returns filed, so that means less than 1 percent were for people who earned at least $1 million.",

        "claim": "The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal). And every environmental organization in this country\u00a0(also) opposes it.",
        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: In the last debate before the Feb. 3 Iowa presidential precinct caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA) did not go far enough to protect the environment or the rights of workers.\n1: Moderator: \"But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal [the USMCA].\n2: Are you unwilling to compromise?\"\n3: Sanders: \"The AFL-CIO does.\n4: \"The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal).\n5: And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.\"\n6: We found Sanders mostly correct in stating\u00a0major organizations oppose the USMC, although stating that every major organization opposes it was a stretch.\n7: Plus, his claims about union support for the deal need some context.\n8: Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign pointed to a letter from a group of 10 high-profile environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, Greenpeace, and others, urging Congress to vote against the USMCA.\n9: The 10 groups signing the letter have a combined 12 million members.\n10: \"We do not get many opportunities to renegotiate trade deals.\n11: At this pivotal moment, we cannot afford to lock ourselves into a multi-decade deal that ignores climate change and helps corporate polluters,\" the letter stated.\n12: However, some large environmental groups did not take a stance on the USMCA.\n13: In an email to The Daily Iowan, representatives from the Environmental Working Group, a nonpartisan conservation nonprofit, said the group has no official stance on the USMCA.\n14: Likewise,\u00a0the Union of Concerned Scientists said the USMCA is not an issue the organization is working on or following.\n15: The USMCA is the new agreement governing trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, updating the nearly 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.\n16: The leaders of the three countries involved in the agreement agreed to the USMCA in November 2018.\n17: The USMCA passed the House of Representatives 385-41 on Dec. 19, 2019, and the Senate 89-10 on Jan. 17, 2020 , with bipartisan support.\n18: Sanders was one of 10 senators to vote no on the agreement.\n19: Channing Dutton, a Des Moines-based attorney and member of Citizens Climate Lobby, said most environmental groups would oppose the agreement because the USMCA does not include provisions for climate change in its current form.\n20: \"It\u2019s a safe bet that every responsible climate change organization would oppose any trade agreement that ignored the effects of climate change or allow easy modification of the agreement because of climate change impacts,\" Dutton said.\n21: Dutton, who has endorsed businessman Tom Steyer\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, added that the agreement cannot be modified to adapt to worsening climate conditions, echoing the concerns environmental groups expressed that the deal cannot be altered to provide provisions for climate change after it becomes law.\n22: \"This is why he [Sanders] said he would not sign the deal without climate change considerations,\" Dutton said.\n23: \"They use the agreement to stop people, communities, states, and even nations from doing things such as adopting the carbon tax that Citizens Climate Lobby supports.\"\n24: Mixed support from labor unions Sanders also brought up during the Des Moines debate the USMCA\u2019s support among unions.\n25: Moderator Brianne Pfannenstiel, the chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register, said the AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 55 national and international labor unions, supports the deal.\n26: The AFL-CIO announced in December 2019 its support for the deal, which it previously opposed, after negotiating with lawmakers to include more provisions for the deal it deemed to be labor-friendly.\n27: \"The USMCA is far from perfect.\n28: It alone is not a solution for outsourcing, inequality or climate change,\" the AFL-CIO said in a prepared statement .\n29: \"Successfully tackling these issues requires a full-court press of economic policies that empower workers, including the repeal of tax cuts which reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.\"\n30: During the debate, Sanders noted that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace (IAM) workers, which has a membership of 600,000, opposes the USMCA.\n31: Although the machinist and aerospace union is part of the AFL-CIO, it issued a statement criticizing the USMCA, though it did not cite concerns over climate change.\n32: \"U.S. workers have been waiting over 25 years for a responsible trade deal that puts their interests ahead of corporations who are fleeing our shores,\" the machinists and aerospace union wrote in the statement.\n33: \"They are still waiting.\n34: The IAM will oppose NAFTA 2.0.\"\n35: Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign cited the IAM statement, as well as statements from the National Family Farm Coalition , which has around 450,000 members, and the United Food and Commercial Workers , with 1.3 million members, as evidence of labor unions upset with the USMCA.\n36: While some unions are in opposition, other large unions have issued statements of support for the newest version of the USMCA.\n37: The Teamsters , a union consisting of truck drivers, mechanical workers and other trades with a membership of 1.4 million, supports the deal.\n38: Additionally, the United Steel Workers, with a membership of 860,000, supported the deal , while the United Auto Workers, membership 990,000, did not explicitly support the deal, but said the deal will need to be strictly enforced to prevent the further loss of U.S. auto industry jobs to Mexico.\n39: \"We will do all we can to vigilantly monitor the agreement to try to make sure multinational corporations live up to their end of the bargain, but we should have no illusion that our efforts alone will get the job done,\" United Auto Workers president Rory Gamble wrote in a prepared statement.",

Thom Tillis is putting immigration at the forefront of his campaign.\n1: And to contrast himself with his Democratic opponents, he\u2019s pointing to state-level policies.\n2: In a Jan. 10 email newsletter, the Tillis campaign said Democrats Cal Cunningham and NC Sen. Erica Smith support \"sanctuary policies.\"\n3: The headline says: \"Sanctuary policies result in gruesome violence, do Cunningham and Smith still support them?\"\n4: The email goes on to talk about an \"illegal immigrant\" who was released from jail in Mecklenburg County \"despite the objections\" of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE).\n5: Is it true that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies?\n6: Not quite.\n7: Cunningham and Smith opposed a bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE.\n8: But neither has flat-out endorsed sanctuary policies.\n9: Each Democrat has said they believe local governments should have the flexibility to comply or not.\n10: About HB 370 There\u2019s no single definition of what constitutes a \"sanctuary city.\"\n11: The term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n12: In some states, a city can ban its law enforcement from cooperating with ICE (thus earning the term \"sanctuary city.\")\n13: But in North Carolina, sanctuary cities are banned.\n14: Former Gov.\n15: Pat McCrory signed a law prohibiting municipalities from blocking ICE cooperation.\n16: However, sheriffs still had (and still have) some wiggle room.\n17: Sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE.\n18: As PolitiFact NC has reported , ICE detainers aren\u2019t valid warrants.\n19: So a handful of Democratic sheriffs declined to honor detainers.\n20: They said they didn\u2019t want to use local resources for federal business, and they feared that cooperating with ICE would harm relationships with their Hispanic constituents.\n21: That brings us to the Tillis campaign\u2019s argument.\n22: North Carolina lawmakers last year considered a bill that would\u2019ve required sheriffs to comply with ICE.\n23: More specifically, the bill -- labeled House Bill 370 --\u00a0 would\u2019ve required North Carolina sheriffs to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE.\n24: Contacted by PolitiFact, Tillis spokesman Andrew Romero said the campaign\u2019s claim is based on Cunningham and Smith opposing House Bill 370.\n25: (PolitiFact has written about HB 370 previously, when President Trump made a Mostly False claim about Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready.)\n26: The GOP-controlled state legislature passed HB 370.\n27: But Democratic Gov.\n28: Roy Cooper vetoed it, so it never became law.\n29: What Cunningham said The Tillis campaign cited an interview Cunningham conducted with WFAE in Charlotte.\n30: Reporter Steve Harrison asked Cunningham if he agreed with the Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s decision to ignore ICE detainer requests.\n31: Cunningham said: \"I tend to trust law enforcement to discharge its duty,\" adding that Mecklenburg voters elected the sheriff and have the power to hold him accountable.\n32: \"I trust the voters in Mecklenburg County to weigh in on exactly that,\" he said.\n33: \"Here\u2019s what I know.\n34: That law enforcement makes difficult decisions every day.\n35: And as a United States senator, it\u2019s not my job to second guess, it\u2019s my job to make sure they have the resources they need to keep their communities safe.\"\n36: The Tillis campaign also noted Cunningham\u2019s opposition to a federal bill Tillis introduced.\n37: The bill that would compel local law enforcement officials to comply with federal detainer requests or face possible civil action by victims and the loss of federal grants.\n38: Asked about the bill, Cunningham campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson accused Tillis of \"threatening funding for North Carolina to score cheap political points,\" the Charlotte Observer reported .\n39: What Smith said As for Smith, she voted against HB 370 when it was before the state Senate.\n40: She also talked about the bill during a couple interviews.\n41: Speaking with WFAE , Smith cited some of the same arguments as Cunningham.\n42: But she also said she would be OK with local law enforcement honoring ICE detainer requests so long as the federal government paid for the costs.\n43: \"I'm fine (with sheriffs) detaining them if the federal government is going to foot the bill and do their jobs.\n44: Certainly, we do not want the release of people who are a threat to public safety,\" she said.\n45: \"But if ICE and Department of Homeland really wants us to close their detention, then they should pay for it.\n46: They're getting taxpayer dollars to do just that.\"\n47: Speaking with Tim Boyum on Spectrum News , Smith made the same argument.\n48: \"If you want the sheriffs to enforce and detain illegal immigrants, then send them the appropriations and the funding.\n49: That is the US Senate\u2019s responsibility.\"",

Hernandez lost his grievance, and his contract would likely prevent him from collecting any of the money now, despite the lack of a conviction on his record.\"\n21: But it\u2019s a moot point now.\n22: The prosecution appealed to have the conviction reinstated, and on March 13, 2019, it was.\n23: The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Hernandez\u2019s murder conviction in a unanimous decision to do away with the legal principle.\n24: The court called the rule \"outdated and no longer consonant with the circumstances of contemporary life,\" and ordered Hernandez\u2019 conviction to be restored and that the practice be abolished for future cases.",

                "However, when contextualizing these self-reported numbers with data showing that only 0.52% of the U.S. population donated $200 or more to political candidates, parties, or political action committees in 2016, it becomes clear that the percentage of Americans who donate to political candidates may be significantly lower than poll-based estimates suggest [22].",
                "Thus, while Yang's claim contains elements of truth, its reliance on self-reported survey data, instead of objective donation records, may inflate the actual proportion of Americans who donate to political candidates."

        "passage": "0: Supporters of a California ballot measure that would remove some of Proposition 13\u2019s tax protections say claims shared thousands of times on\u00a0Facebook and other social media platforms have distorted their initiative.\n1: The campaign for the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2020 , also known as the \"split-roll\" measure, is still gathering signatures to qualify for the November ballot.\n2: It is backed by a group of union and social justice organizations.\n3: If approved by voters, the\u00a0measure would hike taxes on factories, stores and other commercial and industrial real estate by requiring they pay property tax based on current market value rather than the value of the property when it was purchased.\n4: \u00e2\u20ac\u2039 It would raise an estimated $7.5 billion to $12 billion annually, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n5: The money would be distributed to schools and local governments.\n6: The proposed ballot measure, however, would not touch tax protections for homeowners.\n7: Yet many claims on social media suggest the initiative would repeal all parts of Prop.\n8: 13, stoking concerns that residential property taxes could spike.\n9: Here\u2019s one example posted on Facebook Dec. 31, 2019: A similar Facebook post by Bakersfield Tuff , a media company focused on racing and rodeo, was shared more than 2,200 times.\n10: Others have appeared on the platforms Next Door and We Chat, according to the campaign for the initiative.\n11: Do these claims distort the truth?\n12: We set out on a fact check to find out.\n13: Background on Prop.\n14: 13 In 1978, voters approved Prop.\n15: 13, which slashed property taxes and limited how much they could go up.\n16: It also tied tax rates to a property\u2019s purchase price, rather than to the fluctuations of California\u2019s real estate market, ensuring homeowners greater financial stability.\n17: The law remains popular among homeowners and business groups, who argue it allows neighborhoods to stay intact and older residents on fixed-incomes to remain in their homes rather than being forced out by high tax bills.\n18: Groups such as Californians to Stop Higher Property Taxes have warned that removing Prop.\n19: 13\u2019s commercial tax protections will lead companies to pass along any increased tax burden to consumers.\n20: Critics of Prop.\n21: 13, on the other hand, say the law has cut too deeply into the foundation of tax revenue for local governments.\n22: Social Media Claims \u2018Completely False\u2019 The campaign spearheading the November ballot measure contacted PolitiFact about the social media claims.\n23: \"They are completely false,\" said Alex Stack, spokesperson for the initiative .\n24: \"It would completely protect and exempt all residential property, that means homeowners, renters and seniors.\"\n25: That\u2019s backed up by the initiative\u2019s official title and summary prepared by the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n26: That document says the measure exempts \"residential properties; agricultural properties; and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less.\"\n27: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra\u00a0(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Becerra's Role The social media posts claimed Becerra \"was putting together plans\" to \"eliminate\" Prop.\n28: 13\n29: There\u2019s no evidence to substantiate that.\n30: Becerra and others attorneys general, however, have been criticized for drafting misleading ballot measure titles and summaries.\n31: For example, Becerra was accused of giving an earlier version of this measure a friendly write-up.\n32: But attorneys general do not initiate ballot measures.\n33: A spokesperson for Becerra declined to directly address the social media posts.\n34: Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at Sacramento State University, said the claim about Becerra planning to repeal Prop.\n35: 13 is clearly wrong and described the rest of the information as \"cleverly fuzzy.\"\n36: \"It\u2019s very intelligently written,\" he said of the posts, suggesting they may have originated with a political operative.\n37: \"Only one or two spots are wrong.\n38: A lot is political opinion.\"\n39: There\u2019s no doubting the ballot measure\u2019s significance, Hussey added.\n40: It would be \"a dramatic revision\" to Prop.\n41: 13\n42: \"If passed, it would be by far the biggest change we\u2019ve seen\" since voters approved the law, he said.\n43: Keith Smith is a political science professor at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, where he studies elections and voting behavior.\n44: He agreed the claim about Becerra was technically wrong.\n45: But given that the initiative represents a big change to Prop.\n46: 13, some voters may see it as \"a gateway\" to repealing the measure altogether.\n47: Asked if social media posts were accurate, he replied: \"It depends on your perspective.\n48: Is [Prop.\n49: 13] going away?\n50: No, it\u2019s not going away.\n51: Is [the ballot measure] proposing to do away with some aspect of Prop.\n52: 13 that currently exists?\n53: Yes.\"\n54: The claims published on Facebook and other sites, Smith explained, could be more convincing to voters than any details in the ballot measure.\n55: Earlier this month, ABC 10 Sacramento examined similar claims and found there\u2019s no effort to eliminate Prop.\n56: 13\n57: Adding to the confusion about the proposed November ballot measure, there\u2019s a voter initiative on California\u2019s March primary ballot called Proposition 13, the School and College Facilities Bond .\n58: But it has nothing to do with the landmark measure of the same name passed four decades ago.\n59: A spokesman for the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office said that the numbers assigned to propositions are reused through the years, sometimes leading to duplicates.",

general fund The first part alleges the Democratic Party \"took Social Security from the independent \u2018Trust Fund\u2019 and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it.\"\n14: The Social Security Administration says: \"There has never been any change in the way the Social Security program is financed or the way that Social Security payroll taxes are used by the federal government.\n15: \u2026 From its inception, the Trust Fund has always worked the same way.\n16: The Social Security Trust Fund has never been \u2018put into the general fund of the government.\u2019 \"Most likely this question comes from a confusion between the financing of the Social Security program and the way the Social Security Trust Fund is treated in federal budget accounting.\n17: Starting in 1969, the transactions to the Trust Fund were included in what is known as the \u2018unified budget.\u2019 This means that every function of the federal government is included in a single budget.\n18: ...This budget treatment of the Social Security Trust Fund continued until 1990 when the Trust Funds were again taken \u2018off-budget.\u2019 This means only that they are shown as a separate account in the federal budget.\n19: But whether the Trust Funds are \u2018on-budget\u2019 or \u2018off-budget\u2019 is primarily a question of accounting practices \u2014 it has no effect on the actual operations of the Trust Fund itself.\"\n20: While the Social Security trust fund balances weren't affected by the accounting change, \"what economists and other policy analysts were concerned with is whether combining Social Security's surpluses with the on-budget's deficits encouraged policymakers to run larger deficits in the non-Social Security part of the budget,\" said American Enterprise Institute scholar Andrew Biggs, a former deputy commissioner with the Social Security Administration.\n21: \"For example, let's imagine that the public demanded that budget deficits be no more than, say, $100 billion per year.\n22: If they exceeded that amount, voters would consider Congress to be fiscally irresponsible and punish them at the next election.\n23: But if Social Security were running a $100 billion surplus, then Congress could run a $200 billion deficit in the rest of the budget while still reporting only a $100 billion unified budget deficit,\" Biggs told us.\n24: \"Most research has concluded that this is pretty much what happened: surpluses in Social Security encouraged Congress to run larger deficits in the rest of the budget, either by taxing less or spending more.\"\n25: No tax deduction The second part of the claim is that the Democratic Party\u00a0 \"eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding.\"\n26: This too is inaccurate.\n27: \"There was never any provision of law making the Social Security taxes paid by employees deductible for income tax purposes.\n28: In fact, the 1935 law expressly forbid this idea,\" the Social Security administration says.",

        "passage": "0: Pete Buttigieg is running in the Democratic primary for president, but he said a lot of \"future former Republicans\" are coming to hear his ideas.\n1: \"I am proposing things that most Americans even in conservative states think we ought to do,\" including gun control, Buttigieg said Jan. 26 at a Fox News town hall in Des Moines.\n2: \"More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks,\" the former South Bend, Ind., mayor said.\n3: We\u2019ve fact-checked multiple claims about support for expanding background checks among the general public and NRA members .\n4: So what about support for universal background checks among Republicans?\n5: Many Democrats running for president have called for universal background checks , which would extend such checks to private sales, including at gun shows.\n6: The House in 2019 passed a bill to ban the private transfer of firearms without a background check, but it hasn\u2019t been heard in the Senate.\n7: RELATED: Do gun background checks work?\n8: What the research shows Polls about background checks show majority GOP support Buttigieg\u2019s campaign pointed to two polls that backed up his point.\n9: Both followed the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton in August 2019.\n10: While one could argue that such timing could affect the public\u2019s willingness to support stricter measures on guns, we found support was also above 80% before those mass shootings.\n11: A Politico/Morning Consult poll in August 2019 found that 90% of Republicans said they would back background checks for all gun sales.\n12: A Washington Post-ABC News poll in September 2019 found that 83% of Republicans support requiring background checks for all potential buyers.\n13: We looked at other polls in recent years and found that between 82% and 95% of Republicans stated support for background checks for all buyers.\n14: NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll in July 2019 found that 84% of Republicans said it was a good idea to require background checks at gun shows and private sales.\n15: Gallup found in 2017 that 95% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers after the Las Vegas shooting.\n16: ( Gallup didn\u2019t include the statistic specifically for Republicans in their original press release because there wasn\u2019t a significant difference between parties, but a spokeswoman gave us the information.)\n17: Quinnipiac polls between 2013 and 2019 showed that between 86% and 92% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers.\n18: Pew Research Center found in a September 2019 poll that 82% of Republicans favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.\n19: Polls can differ from responses to specific legislation or ballot questions The National Rifle Association has pointed to the results of background check referendums in Maine and Nevada in 2016 that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls suggest.\n20: In Maine , 52% rejected a background check measure.\n21: In Nevada , a background check question just barely passed with about 50.5% of the vote.\n22: Leading up to the election, polls showed higher support for the measures.\n23: The gist of the NRA\u2019s argument is that when people are asked a generic question by a pollster, that leads to a different result than when they actually face a question on a ballot that could affect their own rights.\n24: Pew Research Center found in 2013 that support for expanded background checks isn\u2019t necessarily the same as support for specific legislation.\n25: Pew\u2019s poll found 81% of Republicans supported expanded background checks, but when asked if they supported a U.S. Senate bill that included such legislation, Republican support dropped to 57%.\n26: That still suggests strong support, though by a smaller margin.\n27: Some respondents expressed concerns that the bill included restrictions beyond background checks or would lead to a \"slippery slope.\"\n28: \"People may support background checks in general, but become more skeptical when gun rights groups highlight specific complications or unintended consequences that could arise when these laws are implemented,\" said Kristin Goss, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University.\n29: Also, it\u2019s possible that some respondents who say they want background checks for all sales may not realize that it is not current federal law -- a point backed up by a 2013 poll done for the Democratic National Committee.\n30: Of the 50% of people who said they preferred enforcement over new laws, 48% said they thought federal law prohibits gun purchases privately or at a gun show without a background check.\n31: Another 10% disclosed that they didn\u2019t know the rules.\n32: \"Most people don\u2019t have a very good grasp of what our gun laws are,\" Goss said.\n33: \"To be fair to Americans, gun laws are complicated and vary greatly state by state.\"",

her removal as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n1: \"Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?\"\n2: Kelly asked him.\n3: Pompeo said he had \"defended every State Department official.\"\n4: \"Sir, respectfully, where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch?\"\n5: Kelly asked.\n6: \"I've defended every single person on this team,\" Pompeo said Jan. 24.\n7: \"I've done what's right for every single person on this team.\"\n8: Kelly asked him to point to remarks where he\u2019d defended Yovanovitch.\n9: Pompeo did not do that.\n10: Yovanovitch was the point person for American anti-corruption policy in Ukraine and later became the target of smears by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n11: Trump also disparaged her foreign service history.\n12: We rated Trump\u2019s inaccurate claims about her as Pants on Fire .\n13: RELATED : Who is Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine removed by Trump?\n14: We wanted to know if Pompeo had defended Yovanovitch.\n15: So we reviewed more than 120 State Department transcripts of interviews Pompeo had with online news agencies, TV, radio, and newspaper reporters since May 2019, the month that Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in Ukraine.\n16: We found no record of Pompeo publicly defending Yovanovitch.\n17: When asked, he broadly spoke about defending all State Department employees without defending anyone in particular.\n18: We found no indication of Pompeo defending her to the press at conferences or while traveling to events.\n19: The Twitter accounts for Pompeo, the State Department, and the department\u2019s press secretary also don\u2019t show a defense of Yovanovitch.\n20: The State Department did not respond to our queries asking for evidence for Pompeo\u2019s claim.\n21: Here are some typical interviews where Pompeo was directly asked about Yovanovitch and his lack of a public defense for the former ambassador.\n22: Oct. 20 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC\u2019s This Week In an extensive back-and-forth , ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos asked Pompeo whether he was aware of Giuliani\u2019s push to get rid of Yovanovitch.\n23: Pompeo said \"she's a foreign service officer in good standing,\" that ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president, and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest for ambassadors to leave their post if the president has lost confidence in them.\n24: \"I'm not going to get into personnel matters inside the State Department.\n25: I\u2019ve not done it and I\u2019m not going to do it for you here this morning,\" Pompeo said.\n26: Stephanopoulos said many foreign service professionals believe Pompeo had a duty to speak up for her and protect her in that position.\n27: \"George, in good time all of the facts surrounding each of these incidents will become clear.\n28: But it's not appropriate for me to comment on all of the things that happen inside of personnel decisions,\" Pompeo said.\n29: \"None of our foreign service officers would welcome the Secretary of State talking about why someone stayed, why someone was removed, why someone was transferred.\n30: It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.\"\n31: Oct. 11 interviews with Tennessee media Nancy Amons of WSMV in Nashville told Pompeo that career diplomats had publicly expressed frustration over what they saw as Pompeo\u2019s failure to stand up for government employees.\n32: \"Did you do enough to defend the ambassador, privately and publicly, against the smear campaign that was being waged against her, and will you speak to that now?\"\n33: Amons asked. \"\n34: Well, ma\u2019am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,\" Pompeo said .\n35: He went on to say he was proud of the work done by the State Department. \"\n36: I\u2019ve supported every mission that the State Department\u2019s been engaged in and will continue to do that,\" Pompeo replied.\n37: Jason Lamb of WTVF in Nashville also interviewed Pompeo that day.\n38: Lamb told Pompeo that Democrats in a letter had accused him of remaining silent regarding Yovanovitch.\n39: \"The letter says it\u2019s incumbent on you not to further the president\u2019s damaging and unfounded attacks, but to send a simple message to everyone who works at the Department of State: you have their backs,\" Lamb said.\n40: \"What is your message to everyone at the Department of State?\"\n41: \"I have their backs,\" Pompeo said, without saying anything specific about Yovanovitch.\n42: Nov. 18 press briefing On Nov. 18 at a State Department press briefing , Pompeo was asked why he had not made statements of support for employees testifying in the impeachment inquiry.\n43: \"I\u2019m not going to get into the issues surrounding the Democrat impeachment inquiry.\n44: I\u2019m just not going to do it today,\" Pompeo said, according to a State Department transcript.\n45: A reporter asked again: \"But no defense of your employees?\"\n46: \"I always defend State Department employees,\" Pompeo said.\n47: \"It\u2019s the greatest diplomatic corps in the history of the world.\n48: Very proud of the team.\"\n49: New York Times article on John Bolton\u2019s book The New York Times on Jan. 26 reported about an unpublished manuscript for a forthcoming book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n50: The New York Times said Bolton in his book wrote that Pompeo acknowledged privately to him that there was no basis to Giuliani\u2019s claims that Yovanovitch was corrupt and that he believed Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients.\n51: PolitiFact is unable to verify whether that private conversation took place and we\u2019ve seen no public confirmation

        "passage": "0: On the presidential primary campaign trail in Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0brought out a favorite talking point: ways the president can bring down drug prices without waiting for Congress.\n1: It\u2019s not the first time Warren and other candidates have referenced this alleged power.\n2: In this case, she pointed to insulin, EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs as possible targets.\n3: We asked the Warren campaign for the basis of her claim and they directed us to her \"Medicare for All\" transition plan.\n4: It identifies two legal mechanisms \u2015 \"compulsory licensing\" as outlined in 28 U.S. Code Section 1498 and the so-called march-in rights provision of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act.\n5: We spoke to legal and pharmaceutical policy experts about whether those mechanisms could be used to bring down drug prices, as Warren described.\n6: The answer?\n7: Yes.\n8: But it\u2019s complicated and controversial.\n9: The legal mechanisms Of the two legal levers, Section 1498 is perhaps more straightforward.\n10: The law says the government can intervene to take over patents without a company\u2019s permission, if the price is too high.\n11: The government can then create competition to bring down prices by importing those products from abroad, or manufacturing them.\n12: The original manufacturer can sue for damages but cannot stop Washington from breaking the patent.\n13: \"What they would do is announce they are taking other bids from other companies to supply the product\" to government programs such as Medicare, said Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches drug pricing laws and has written extensively about Section 1498.\n14: The provision has been used before \u2015 in the 1960s to procure cheap generic drugs \u2015 and was invoked as recently as 2001, as a threat to get a better price on Ciprofloxacin, a high-powered antibiotic used to treat anthrax.\n15: It also was used in 2014 in non-pharmaceutical contexts, such as by the Defense Department to acquire lead-free bullets.\n16: Invoking this part of the U.S. code wouldn\u2019t necessarily apply to all drugs, said Jacob Sherkow, a professor at New York Law School.\n17: But products such as the ones Warren mentioned \u2015 insulin and EpiPens, for instance, which are patented in the United States and abroad, and cost far less in other countries \u2015 would qualify.\n18: And that could send a message to other drug manufacturers.\n19: \"If you\u2019re a particularly aggressive president, you can find some low-hanging fruit, and use 1498 to show other pharmaceutical companies you\u2019re damn serious,\" Sherkow said.\n20: There are other caveats.\n21: Sherkow noted that licensing a competing drug is only part of the equation; competition often brings down drug prices, but not always.\n22: In addition, not all drugs have equivalent patents here and abroad, which complicates importation.\n23: But many of the technical obstacles are surmountable, argued Amy Kapczynski, a professor at Yale Law School.\n24: The march-in rights authority a little trickier.\n25: Bayh-Dole, the law that created march-in rights, suggests the government can \"march in\" when a drug isn\u2019t available amid concerns over public health, such as an epidemic.\n26: It applies only to pharmaceuticals for which the government holds all the patents because it funded the research that led to their development.\n27: An example could be Truvada for PrEP, the HIV prevention pill, Kesselheim said.\n28: Unlike Section 1498, march-in rights have\u00a0 never been used to negotiate a lower price \u2015 despite multiple petitions to the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that would approve and oversee the process.\n29: The question is whether high prices can constitute both a barrier and a public health concern having rendered\u00a0 a drug unavailable.\n30: Sherkow, for one, expressed skepticism.\n31: NIH has historically opted against making this determination.\n32: For one, its directors have typically argued that cost isn\u2019t within their area of expertise.\n33: And, for another, they have suggested that \"marching in\" would discourage pharmaceutical companies from using government-funded research \u2015 ultimately leading to fewer breakthrough drugs being developed.\n34: \"That is a matter of culture, and I think a president could alter that perspective,\" Kesselheim said.\n35: Doing so, though, would require political capital.\n36: Even though Congress isn\u2019t required to vote on the matter, the president would have to, for instance, appoint officials willing to change the NIH perspective \u2015 and those leaders do require Senate confirmation.\n37: \"You\u2019d probably have to defend it in court,\" Kesselheim added.\n38: Finally, these mechanisms would also draw sharp pushback from the pharmaceutical industry.\n39: Given the fervor over the drug pricing debate, neither Section 1498 nor march-in rights should be used ubiquitously, Kesselheim said.\n40: \"It is a complicated enough and politically charged enough procedure, that it\u2019s something that should be reserved as a safety net for real public health emergencies,\" he said.\n41: \"I think Sen. Warren is identifying some of those cases.\"\n42: They\u2019re all talking about it Warren\u2019s proposals are part of a larger pattern \u2015 Democratic presidential candidates including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2015 have talked about ways to bring down drug prices without congressional action.\n43: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also referenced such action during the January presidential primary debate.\n44: \"I have a plan of 137 things I found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal.\n45: And one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other parties,\" she said.\n46: According to Klobuchar\u2019s campaign, she was referring to a list she published on Medium in June 2019 in which she wrote that she would use \"existing Food and Drug Administration authority to grant a waiver that allows people to import safe prescription drugs for personal use from countries like Canada to decrease drug costs for seniors and all Americans.\"\n47: Sherkow said this is indeed another example.\n48: Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the HHS secretary to order the importation of specific drugs if it would impose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and would result in a significant cost reduction.\n49: But this example also highlights the complexities involved and why it is not necessarily fast or easy.\n50: He pointed out that the president would have to nominate a candidate for secretary, get that person confirmed, then have the secretary make this order in respect to specific drugs, certify that the drugs are safe and would result in cost reduction \u2015 then have the importation take place.\n51: \"Kudos to anyone for trying that in the first 100 days,\" Sherkow said.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: The debate over whether to purge more than 200,000 names from the Wisconsin voter roll continues to bounce around the Wisconsin court system.\n1: An Ozaukee County judge has repeatedly ordered the names be removed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, but the latest order was stayed by an appeals court .\n2: With the matter in limbo, two members of the divided Elections Commission took to the airwaves to make their cases.\n3: The six-member board is evenly split between Republican and Democratic appointees, leading to a series of deadlocked votes on the next steps.\n4: Asked if there was any middle ground, Republican appointee Bob Spindell said the voter roll needs to be updated.\n5: \"These are people that are probably alive, but they\u2019ve moved, I\u2019m sure some have died,\" Spindell said in the Jan. 19, 2020, appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s \u2018 UpFront\u2019 program.\n6: \"This could be a very close (2020 presidential) election, and we don\u2019t have any room for having huge numbers of people on the voting rolls that should not be there.\"\n7: So, in framing his argument, Spindell is saying the fact dead people may be among the 230,000 is a primary reason to move ahead with the full purge.\n8: Democratic appointee Ann Jacobs, appearing with Spindell, objected immediately, saying the list had already been culled for people who had died.\n9: Let\u2019s sort this out.\n10: The background This controversy dates to October 2019, when the Elections Commission sent mailers to 230,000 people saying it believed they may have moved, asking them to update their voter registration or confirm if they lived at the same address.\n11: The commission planned to remove people from the roll in 2021 if the resident took no action.\n12: But three voters \u2014 represented by Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty \u2014 filed a lawsuit arguing the state had to remove the names from the roll faster.\n13: Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy agreed and ordered the names be stricken from the voter roll.\n14: When the commission twice deadlocked on whether to immediately remove the names \u2014 all Republicans for, all Democrats against \u2014 Malloy found the Democratic members in contempt and fined them each $250 per day until names are removed.\n15: An appeals court then stayed both the fines and the order to remove the names.\n16: To be sure, anyone removed from the roll would still be able to vote by re-registering ahead of the election or even at the polls on Election Day.\n17: Doing so would require providing proof of residence, however, which critics say creates an unfair burden and would lead to people being unable to vote if they couldn\u2019t provide the documents in time.\n18: Does the list include dead people?\n19: The Elections Commission maintains a statewide voter registration system, which municipal clerks use to manage their local voter rolls.\n20: Clerks enter new voter registrations and are responsible for activating and deactivating local voters.\n21: Here\u2019s how it works for people who have died: The county coroner issues a death certificate, which is then sent to the state Department of Health Services.\n22: Once a month, DHS sends a file to the state Elections Commission with a list of people who have died, and the commission then alerts municipal clerks to verify the deaths and deactivate the voters, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Elections Commission.\n23: (These updates are made more frequently as elections get close.)\n24: Clerks can also on their own deactivate voters who have died based on information from family members, obituaries or other reliable sources.\n25: Municipal clerks also update voters lists for a variety of other reasons, including when someone has registered to vote in another state, been convicted of a felony, been declared incompetent by a court or moved, Magney said.\n26: In October, the commission used various data sources to flag 232,000 people they believed may have moved, which would require them to re-register at their new address before voting again.\n27: The names came from a database already culled through the normal process for people known to have died, registered elsewhere, etc.\n28: But several months have passed since then.\n29: As of the week Spindell made his claim, 21,802 people who received the mailers in October had been deactivated by their municipal clerk, Magney said.\n30: That included 934 deactivated due to death.\n31: Which people are we talking about?\n32: Spindell\u2019s reference on \"UpFront\" didn\u2019t clarify if he was referring to the original mailing list or the current list with some names removed.\n33: In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, he said he was referring to dead people who had since been removed through the process Magney described.\n34: But his phrasing was in the present tense, saying \"these are people.\"\n35: And he raised the issue of dead voters during a discussion of what to do with the people who remain at risk of having their names removed from the voter roll \u2014 in other words those who are still on the list.\n36: Anyone known to have died wouldn\u2019t be on the list anymore, since the normal process is set up to address that situation and it has continued during the legal battle.\n37: The only dead people on the list are those who have died since the latest regular update, and their names would be removed through the processes already in place.",

our lightning round,\" Hannity said .\n2: \"I\u2019m just going to throw out a name, whatever comes to your mind.\"\n3: When Hannity asked about former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg , Trump said the Democratic National Committee, which recently announced changes to its debate qualification requirements , was bending over backward to benefit him.\n4: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com \"Cory Booker and all these people couldn\u2019t get any of the things that Bloomberg\u2019s getting now,\" he said .\n5: \"I think it\u2019s very unfair for the Democrats.\"\n6: The DNC did make significant changes to its qualification criteria, raising the polling threshold while scrapping the individual donor requirement that candidates previously had to meet.\n7: The DNC\u2019s recent shift does open the door for Bloomberg, who is self-funding his campaign and not taking donations, to participate in a debate for the first time.\n8: But Trump\u2019s claim glosses over important details.\n9: The new rules are different from what Booker asked for, and they don\u2019t guarantee that Bloomberg will earn a spot on stage.\n10: Debate qualification requirements have gradually changed For the DNC\u2019s first two debates, candidates qualified by meeting one of two requirements: Polling at 1% in three national or early-state polls approved by the DNC, or getting donations from 65,000 unique donors, with at least 200 donors per state in 20 different states.\n11: Over time, the requirements became more difficult to satisfy.\n12: At the September debate in Houston, the thresholds for polling and donors increased, and candidates were required to meet both benchmarks , not one or the other.\n13: By the time of the January debate in Des Moines, Iowa \u2014 the seventh on the DNC\u2019s schedule \u2014 the polling threshold had risen to 5% in four national polls or 7% in two early-state polls, and the donor threshold bumped up to 225,000 donors, with 1,000 per state in 20 different states.\n14: Then came the February debates, the first contests scheduled to take place after voters and caucus-goers started making their picks for a nominee.\n15: For the Feb. 7 debate in New Hampshire, the DNC announced that while candidates could still qualify by meeting both the polling and donor thresholds set for the January debate, they could also qualify by earning one delegate to the national convention in the Iowa caucuses.\n16: (Bloomberg hasn\u2019t campaigned in Iowa .)\n17: For the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas, the DNC has eliminated the donor requirement entirely.\n18: Candidates can either qualify by polling at 10% in four national polls or 12% in two early-state polls, or by getting one delegate in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.\n19: (Bloomberg\u2019s name won\u2019t appear on the New Hampshire ballot.)\n20: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the DNC, told Politico that the early primary results will give a greater window into a candidate\u2019s support than the donor tally.\n21: \"The donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations, and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren\u2019t,\" she said, according to Politico .\n22: The DNC\u2019s recent change makes room for Bloomberg Bloomberg\u2019s refusal to take donations precluded him from participating in the DNC\u2019s first seven debates, and because he is skipping the early states, he is unlikely to win the delegates in Iowa or New Hampshire that could put him in the ring for the Feb. 7 debate.\n23: But since candidates can qualify for the Feb. 19 debate simply by hitting the 10% polling mark, Bloomberg, who had called for the DNC to get rid of the donor requirement, now has a shot.\n24: That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll make the stage.\n25: Currently, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have met the 10% polling threshold, according to Politico , which tracks public polling and has identified just one poll that has Bloomberg at 10%.\n26: Watson told us Trump\u2019s suggestion that the change was meant to help Bloomberg was \"false.\"\n27: \"With the primary underway, we are assessing a candidate\u2019s support through a significantly higher polling threshold and through actual election results,\" she said.\n28: \"We were always planning to do this, we signaled it many times, it is not designed to benefit any one candidate, and every candidate has an equal opportunity to qualify.\"\n29: DNC Chairman Tom Perez did signal in November and December that he was considering doing away with the donor threshold for the early 2020 debates, according to reports.\n30: Still, other Democratic candidates have denounced the change, saying the DNC is catering to the billionaire.\n31: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com A Sanders adviser said the change was evidence of a \"rigged system.\"\n32: Warren tweeted that the DNC was letting Bloomberg \"play by different rules.\"\n33: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the change was \"clearly tailor made to deliver (Bloomberg) to the debate stage.\"\n34: Booker, Yang asked for different changes In December, Booker led a push to lower qualification standards so that he, Julian Castro and others would stand a better chance of making the January and February debates.\n35: The New Jersey senator sent a letter , signed by several candidates, requesting that the DNC go back to requiring candidates to meet the polling threshold or the donor threshold, but not both.\n36: The DNC rejected Booker\u2019s petition.\n37: \"Our qualification criteria is extremely low and reflects where we are in the race,\" the committee said in a statement, per Politico .\n38: \"Once voting starts in February, our criteria will reflect those contests, which is more than appropriate.\"\n39: Similarly, Yang asked the DNC to commission more polls so candidates would have a higher likelihood of meeting the polling requirement.\n40: Both of these changes would have made the path to the debates easier.\n41: While the DNC has now scrapped the donor requirement and given candidates the option of qualifying through delegates or the polls, it has also doubled the polling threshold, a change that could potentially cut the number of candidates who qualify for the Nevada debate.\n42: For what it\u2019s worth, the donor threshold was not usually the requirement keeping candidates from the debates.\n43: Bloomberg is the only candidate who failed to qualify for a debate specifically because of the donor requirement, according to Politico .\n44: But it wasn\u2019t nothing.\n45: Booker campaign staffers, for example, have described having to divert resources in order to satisfy the committee\u2019s donor thresholds.",

Val Demings, D-Fla., Jan. 29.\n3: \"Contrary to the president\u2019s tweet that all of the aid arrived and that it arrived ahead of schedule, that\u00a0is not true.\n4: All of the aid has not arrived.\"\n5: As Demings said, Trump was wrong to say the aid was delivered ahead of time (see this report from FactCheck.org. )\n6: But we wanted to know whether Ukraine was still waiting on some amount of American support, even now.\n7: Aid, interrupted Demings has a point that not every dollar intended for Ukraine has been delivered.\n8: The money was supposed to come in two pots: $250 million managed by the Pentagon for military aid and $141 million managed by the State Department.\n9: Trump\u2019s hold on the aid last summer sent it off the usual path.\n10: The question about what federal dollars have not yet arrived relates to defense money.\n11: Here\u2019s a refresher on the relevant events from 2019: June 18: The Defense Department announced plans to provide $250 million to Ukraine.\n12: July: Trump ordered the Defense Department money, and $141 million in State Department aid, to be frozen ahead of his July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n13: Emails show that Pentagon and OMB staff were scrambling to freeze the aid July 24-25, and paperwork to freeze the aid was in the works before the phone call.\n14: The New York Times reported that Trump first asked about freezing the aid in June.\n15: Aug. 12: A whistleblower filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call and related actions.\n16: Sept. 11: Under pressure, the White House released nearly $400 million of frozen U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n17: The White House\u2019s reversal didn\u2019t leave time to disburse all of the money before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.\n18: On Sept. 27, 2019, Trump signed a continuing appropriations bill to extend the $250 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds for another year.\n19: Most of the aid was obligated, the term the federal government uses to refer to money that the government has promised to spend.\n20: But a small portion wasn\u2019t.\n21: Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management Budget, said in his House deposition that roughly $35 million had not been obligated.\n22: Without the September extension, those funds would have expired, he said.\n23: Some of those funds were intended for lethal equipment and radars, according to a Nov. 18 letter from four Democratic senators .\n24: About 93% of the $250 million designated for Ukraine by Congress has been obligated, said Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason.\n25: That means about $17 million has not yet been obligated.\n26: Officials at the Office of Management and Budget have argued that it\u2019s common for agencies to not fully spend their money by the end of the fiscal year, including for Ukraine aid .\n27: But the Government Accountability Office concluded that the office violated the federal Impoundment Control Act by withholding security assistance to Ukraine.\n28: \"It\u2019s atypical that $35 million out of $250 million wouldn\u2019t be spent by the end of the fiscal year, especially when (the Defense Department) certified that Ukraine was meeting the anti-corruption and transparency conditions outlined by Congress,\" said Seamus P.

An \u2018apples-to-oranges measure\u2019 We took a look at the most recent voter registration and population data from Iowa\u2019s government and the Census Bureau.\n18: The numbers don\u2019t support what Kirk said, and experts say comparing them is flawed.\n19: Among the counties identified by Judicial Watch, none have more active registered voters than adults.\n20: For example, Scott County \u2014 the largest county included in the Judicial Watch story \u2014 has an estimated population of 131,961 people ages 18 and older, according to 2018 data from the Census\u2019s American Community Survey.\n21: According to the Iowa secretary of state, there are 127,737 total voter registrations, 115,393 of which are active.\n22: Judicial Watch\u2019s story looked at \"total registrations,\" which includes inactive voters.\n23: In Iowa, inactive voters are those that have not responded to notices from the state asking them to verify their registration and residence.\n24: Only one county, Lyon, has more total registered voters than adults: 8,490 to 8,430.\n25: But that data is from 2018.\n26: The Iowa secretary of state\u2019s office says 8,117 of voters in Lyon County are active.\n27: Either way, experts say comparing voter rolls and Census estimates isn\u2019t an accurate measurement of registration rates.\n28: \"That\u2019s an apples-to-oranges measure.\n29: They measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,\" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, in an email.\n30: \"And so it\u2019s really bad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there\u2019s fraud.\"\n31: Even if there were more registered voters than voting-age adults in some Iowa counties, experts told us it would not amount to voter fraud.\n32: \"For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you\u2019d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,\" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine.\n33: \"Not only would that be a difficult thing to do \u2026 you\u2019d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you\u2019ve paid to do this have voted.\"\n34: Voter fraud remains rare in American elections.\n35: A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011.",

        "passage": "0: When it comes to weather and climate change, there has been lots of talk about causes and consequences.\n1: In some areas of Wisconsin this winter, rapidly melting snow has overtaken roads and caused sewage to overflow , while flooding and its effects continue to be a concern.\n2: The National Weather Service in Green Bay indicated most rivers in northeastern Wisconsin have more than a 50% chance of flooding to some extent .\n3: Whether it be the toll on infrastructure or disrupting business operations, weather and climate change carries a monetary cost.\n4: On Dec. 10, 2019, the U.S. Senate Democrats\u2019 Climate Committee sent out a tweet arguing Wisconsin roads and bridges are at risk of collapse from severe storms and flooding.\n5: That same day, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., tweeted this about the national cost: \"Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion and our economy will lose over $500 billion annually from lost labor, crop failure and damages related to extreme weather if we don\u2019t #ActOnClimate now.\"\n6: Is Baldwin right about $400 billion-plus in damages?\n7: The source When asked for backup for the claim, Baldwin\u2019s staff pointed to The Fourth National Climate Assessment , a 1,526-page document that examines the effects, risks and course of climate change in the United States.\n8: The Fourth National Climate Assessment is a cooperative effort between experts from academia and government agencies , such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n9: On page 66, the report indicates NOAA estimates the United States incurred $400 billion in damages from weather and climate disasters from 2015 through April 6, 2018.\n10: But that figure is for different years and a longer time period (three-plus years) than Baldwin claimed.\n11: NOAA climatologist Adam Smith from the Center for Weather and Climate at NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., noted the numbers in the report are also a bit dated.\n12: He pointed us to newer figures.\n13: Baldwin\u2019s reference was to the \"past two years.\"\n14: She made the statement in December 2019, so examining the two-year span immediately before that, her numbers are dramatically off.\n15: NOAA estimates the U.S. experienced $137.8 billion of economic damage from 2018 and 2019 when adjusted for the consumer price index, and $135.6 billion unadjusted.\n16: However, looking at the two most recent full years before Baldwin\u2019s claim \u2014 2017 and 2018 \u2014 Baldwin\u2019s figures line up.\n17: NOAA estimates the inflation-adjusted damage in those calendar years was $411.7 billion.\n18: The NOAA calculation includes damage to buildings and public infrastructure, among other costs .\n19: The agency tracks damage from drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires and winter storms.\n20: Smith said in an email NOAA uses data from agencies such as the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Interagency Fire Center.\n21: There are some types of data they do not include due to inconsistencies.\n22: \"For example, our disaster cost estimates are actually somewhat conservative, as we don\u2019t account for losses/damages to natural capital assets, mental and physical healthcare-related costs post-disaster, or incorporate all downstream economic impacts,\" Smith wrote.\n23: We checked with several experts from academia who agreed that the NOAA numbers are probably the best available for the United States.\n24: The agency\u2019s data shows that the number of disasters that topped $1 billion in damages has increased each decade since the 1980s.\n25: There were 119 weather and climate disasters that topped that threshold during the 2010s, up from 59 in the 2000s, even after adjusting for inflation.\n26: Over the past three years (2017 through 2019), there was an average of nearly 15 disasters that topped $1 billion in damages.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) that would establish a universal, government-funded health care system.\n3: They\u2019re the flagship Medicare for All proposals\u00a0 and have shaped a large portion of the 2020 campaign discourse on health care.\n4: We reached out to the White House to confirm that Trump was referring to these plans, but didn\u2019t hear back.\n5: That said, Trump has made similar remarks before about Medicare for All.\n6: And he is on target with his co-sponsor estimate for these bills.\n7: The Sanders measure has 14 Senate co-sponsors and the Jayapal legislation has 118 in the House.\n8: His remarks were dramatic, though, in highlighting the proposal\u2019s alleged consequences for undocumented immigrants.\n9: And health policy experts told us Trump missed the mark.\n10: The immigration question Trump is correct in his understanding that these proposals were intended to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.\n11: But evidence does not support his argument that Medicare for All would \"bankrupt\" the country by extending health insurance coverage to everyone, and to immigrants in the country illegally in particular.\n12: One point: While the single-payer system outlined in the pending legislative proposals would increase public spending \u2014 and by a significant amount \u2014 its backers say that total health care spending likely wouldn\u2019t change that much.\n13: That\u2019s because, as the plan is envisioned, while government spending would go up, private health expenditures would disappear.\n14: \"Medicare for All would dramatically shift how we pay for health care, but not necessarily how much we spend in total,\" said Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n15: \"It\u2019s hard to make the case that it would bankrupt the country.\"\n16: (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n17: Furthermore, to suggest that providing them with insurance would bankrupt the country is misleading.\n18: Those immigrants make up a small size of the population \u2014 about 11 million, compared to the total national population of approximately 372 million.\n19: \"A very, very small percentage of the total cost is associated with that 11 million people,\" said Linda Blumberg, an analyst at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank.\n20: \"We\u2019re talking about a strawman.\"\n21: In fact, she noted, many existing programs on the state, county and local level already provide health benefits to undocumented immigrants.\n22: Those programs haven\u2019t led to bankruptcy.\n23: Part of a broader theme Trump\u2019s claim on health care for undocumented immigrants was part of a larger broadside on Democratic health proposals.\n24: He also argued Democrats would \"impose a socialist takeover of our health care system\" and \"raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on.\"\n25: Those statements are also misleading.\n26: For one thing, Levitt noted, Medicare for All would not socialize the medical care system, even if it would replace private insurance with all public programs.\n27: Under the current proposals, hospitals and doctors would still stand as private entities.\n28: \"It would in no way mean a socialist takeover of the health care system,\" Levitt said.\n29: \"When Americans think of health care, I suspect they think of the people who actually deliver that care.\"\n30: The idea of \"raiding\" Medicare is also tricky, as we noted last October .\n31: While the single-payer plan would replace conventional Medicare with a new government program, that program (according to the Sanders and Jayapal bills) would have more generous benefits than Medicare currently offers.\n32: If anything, then, benefits wouldn\u2019t be raided; they would be bolstered.\n33: The result, analysts said: a series of arguments that distracts from the actual debate at hand.\n34: \"It is worthwhile having a serious debate over the inherent tradeoffs of the reform being discussed,\" Blumberg said.\n35: \"But this is the same kind of throwaway line and inflammatory language to thwart serious conversation.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: During the 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump slammed \"sanctuary cities\" for their limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n1: \"In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed,\" he said.\n2: Trump cited an incident in which an undocumented immigrant released from custody allegedly assaulted and killed a 92-year-old woman in New York City.\n3: Trump also spotlighted the brother of a man killed in a crime spree by an undocumented immigrant released in California.\n4: \"The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens,\" he said, calling on Congress to pass a bill to let victims sue sanctuary cities.\n5: There\u2019s no federal definition for a sanctuary city, and the details vary from place to place.\n6: But broadly speaking, the term refers to any jurisdiction that refuses to continue holding people in local jails beyond their jail or prison sentence solely because ICE has asked the jurisdiction to do so.\n7: (ICE\u2019s request is formally known as a detainer.)\n8: The individual cases Trump addressed were documented in media reports, and the White House has published a list of other criminal noncitizens shielded from ICE officials.\n9: But Trump\u2019s claim that local officials \"order police to release dangerous criminal aliens\" makes setting criminals free sounds like standard operating procedure.\n10: As we detailed while fact-checking a similar claim in 2018 , that\u2019s not the case.\n11: Even sanctuary cities typically turn over to ICE many of the felons Trump warns about.\n12: The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n13: It\u2019s unclear how frequently this happens ICE news releases report numerous instances of ignored detainer requests that result in undocumented immigrants being set free and later arrested by ICE.\n14: According to ICE\u2019s report for the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the roughly 143,000 noncitizens arrested by ICE had criminal convictions or pending charges.\n15: It\u2019s unclear how many were arrested after being released in sanctuary cities.\n16: The report says ICE issued 165,487 detainers to law enforcement officials, and that \"a number of aliens who have been released under these circumstances have gone on to commit additional crimes.\"\n17: Some insight came during an October Senate hearing , when ICE official Timothy Robbins said the agency brought roughly 1,300 noncitizens into custody over the span of a \"few weeks,\" including \"large numbers\" of people who had been released in sanctuary cities.\n18: Robbins said three of those 1,300 people had prior convictions for manslaughter or murder, 100 had convictions for sexual assault or related crimes, 70 had convictions for drug-related crimes, and 320 had convictions for driving under the influence.\n19: \"Almost 200 of the aliens arrested during the most recent operation could have been taken into custody at local jails if the detainer had been honored,\" Robbins said.\n20: Robbins did not say whether any of the 200 people ICE targeted with detainers went on to commit further crimes or, in Trump\u2019s words, \"prey\" on Americans.\n21: Violent felons and others can usually be detained Sanctuary policies across the country treat dangerous criminals differently, but experts told us many have specific ways of dealing with them.\n22: \"A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses,\" Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told us .\n23: \"You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant.\n24: Each of these mean different things.\"\n25: California\u2019s sanctuary law , for example, gives law enforcement officials leeway to hold someone for ICE if they\u2019ve committed one of a number of crimes.\n26: The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses.\n27: In New York City , people convicted of one or more of 177 types of felonies within the last five years can be handed over to ICE authorities, but only if those authorities secure a warrant first.\n28: Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, told us she\u2019s \"unaware of a jurisdiction that releases \u2018dangerous criminal aliens\u2019 as a matter of policy.\"\n29: \"Where jurisdictions have set limits on their cooperation with ICE typically revolve around the issue of whether the agency is seeking transfer of a noncitizen who has been booked or charged versus an offender who is completing a criminal sentence, as well as whether ICE needs to seek a court order for the request to detain a noncitizen,\" she added.\n30: Trump\u2019s examples Mittelstadt explained that when noncitizens are released in sanctuary cities, \"the criminal justice process has taken place or is taking place as it would in the case of anyone else.\"\n31: \"When state and local prisons release noncitizens without transfer to ICE, the person has completed their criminal sentence, has been released without charge, or has been charged and released on bond pending further action in the criminal justice system,\" she said.\n32: The New York City murder suspect Trump mentioned had originally been arrested for attacking his father with a broken coffee cup and arraigned on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon before he was released pending trial, according to reports .\n33: He had not yet been convicted on those charges by the time of the alleged murder.\n34: Meanwhile, the California man who went on a crime spree in 2018 had previously been convicted of armed robbery.\n35: But the charge was 15 years old, meaning local police couldn\u2019t use it to justify holding him for ICE, according to the Washington Post .\n36: He had been deported twice before, in 2004 and 2014, and was arrested in 2018 after a caller reported erratic behavior.\n37: He tested positive for use of a controlled substance, but because that offense only carried a misdemeanor charge, he was released after 10 hours in custody.\n38: Mike Boudreaux, the county sheriff on the case, blamed California\u2019s sanctuary law for keeping his officers from coordinating with ICE authorities.\n39: \"That tool has been removed from our hands,\" he said, according to the Washington Post .\n40: \"And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal.\"",

Steven Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University.\n27: \u2018Waiting lists are the currently eligible people who bothered to sign up to wait, not all of the people eligible and unserved,\" he said.",

        "passage": "0: One of the biggest themes of President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address \u2014 and one of the biggest themes of his reelection campaign \u2014 is that he inherited a weak economy from President Barack Obama and turned it into a strong economy by implementing his own policies.\n1: \"The years of economic decay are over,\" he told the joint session of Congress on Feb. 4, 2020.\n2: \"The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.\n3: Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige.\"\n4: Trump added, \"If we hadn\u2019t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.\"\n5: When we reached out to the Trump campaign, they offered several statistics showing Trump has notched greater gains than Obama did, such as manufacturing job creation, the unemployment rate, and economic growth.\n6: We found those statistics, and other specific facts Trump cited during the State of the Union , were accurate, or largely so.\n7: However, unlike Obama, who inherited the Great Recession, Trump inherited an economy that was already getting back on its feet.\n8: Overall, we found a continuation of the favorable trend lines Trump inherited from Obama.\n9: We looked at 15 common economic statistics, from unemployment rates to growth in gross domestic product to poverty, foreclosures, and bank failures.\n10: They cover the period of the Great Recession until today.\n11: Where possible, we\u2019ve highlighted periods under a Republican president in red and periods under a Democratic president in blue.\n12: The bottom line: For virtually each of these measurements, we found that the trend lines continued almost seamlessly from the second half of Obama\u2019s presidency into the first three years of Trump\u2019s tenure.\n13: Trump\u2019s claim that he turned around a failing economy is wrong.\n14: \"I do not think economic gains have been any faster or better under Trump than gains we would have forecast based on the steady improvements we saw in the economy and job market in President Obama\u2019s second term,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.\n15: Also, no president has total control over the factors affecting the economy.\n16: Broader trends beyond their powers \u2014 from international economic conditions to technological changes \u2014 shape the course of the economy as well.\n17: \"All our decisions together produce the economy,\" said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota economist.\n18: \"It doesn't change when the resident of the White House does.\"\n19: Employment statistics For unemployment rates and for median weeks of unemployment, the declines under Obama were at least as fast \u2014 if not faster \u2014 than they have been under Trump.\n20: That holds for several of the racial and ethnic groups Trump often cites in speeches, as well as for women.\n21: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Meanwhile, since the recovery gained speed, the pattern of monthly job gains has been quite similar under both Obama and Trump.\n22: That\u2019s also broadly true for manufacturing job gains, a metric that Trump has been especially focused on.\n23: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The percentage of Americans either working or looking for work took longer to recover than other statistics, and it still hasn\u2019t returned to pre-recession levels.\n24: This statistic did fall for most of Obama\u2019s tenure, but it started to rise in his final year and has continued to rise under Trump.\n25: Wages Inflation-adjusted wages fell for much of Obama\u2019s first term, but they began rising again during his second term.\n26: Their path under Trump has been along much the same trajectory.\n27: Gross domestic product As a candidate, Trump promised 4% economic growth.\n28: But he\u2019s never hit that mark in any quarter (Obama did so in four quarters) and he has hit 3% in four quarters, the same number that Obama did during an equivalent period, his final three years in office.\n29: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Poverty and food stamps The poverty rate and food stamp use has declined under Trump.\n30: Those declines began during Obama\u2019s final years in office.\n31: Credit and banking The big declines in foreclosures, bankruptcies and bank failures occurred under Obama, with marginal advances under Trump.\n32: The stock market Trump often touts how the stock market has risen on his watch, and it has, to record levels.\n33: But a look at the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, a broad measure of stock market value, shows that the markets have risen at roughly the same rate under both presidents.\n34: Consumer confidence Trump may have his strongest argument on the most intangible of these statistics: consumer confidence.\n35: Regular measurements by Gallup and the University of Michigan show a \"breakpoint right after the election\" in Trump\u2019s favor, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com.\n36: In Gallup\u2019s measure, for instance, the statistic broke into positive territory with Trump\u2019s election and has stayed there, after being in negative territory for virtually all of Obama\u2019s tenure.\n37: \"Multiple economic confidence measures took an immediate and sustained jump after the election, even though it's hard to find similar shifts among the key measures of actual economic performance,\" Kolko said.\n38: But another widely tracked statistic, the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index, shows a continuing rise during Obama\u2019s full tenure that presaged the later heights Trump reached.",

Sean Casten of Downers Grove, who holds the 6th District west suburban seat she wants.\n2: A press release from her campaign states Casten \"demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released.\"\n3: That\u2019s a reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s account of his investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, including possible ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials.\n4: A redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report released on April 18 affirmed the Trump campaign thought it would benefit from Russia\u2019s election interference.\n5: But the report did not establish coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n6: It also detailed the president\u2019s efforts to curtail the nearly two-year probe.\n7: Casten was critical of Trump during this time but the freshman congressman did not announce his support for launching an impeachment inquiry until two months after Mueller\u2019s report was made public.\n8: And, even then, he did not say he would vote yes on articles of impeachment drawn up by the House until December .\n9: \"I didn\u2019t run for Congress to impeach the President,\" Casten said in a June 20 press release that noted he had read the report and was alarmed by its findings.\n10: \"But I also ran for office because I felt the people of my District deserved transparency from their elected representative.\n11: That\u2019s why, after much thought and careful deliberation, I support opening an impeachment inquiry into the President of the United States.\"\n12: So we contacted Ives\u2019 campaign to find out what she was referencing.\n13: Instead of providing evidence showing Casten had gone public with his support for impeachment prior to the release of Mueller\u2019s report, spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy highlighted a different point on the timeline.\n14: \"He didn't wait for Mueller's congressional testimony,\" Murphy wrote in an email.\n15: \"Casten was only interested in getting whatever thinly veiled contrivance he could get to support a position he\u2019s had from the day Trump was elected: removing Trump from office.\n16: As soon as the Mueller report was released, he ran screaming into the public square to declare it what he wished upon a star it would be rather than what it actually was.\"\n17: Murphy also claimed Casten voiced support for impeachment before he was even elected, pointing to a 2018 Sun-Times candidate questionnaire in which he stated that \"strong and plentiful evidence\" of Russian election interference could not be ignored.\n18: \"It is imperative that the Mueller investigation into this matter be allowed to continue to its conclusion without obstruction from the White House or interference by Congress,\" Casten continued, a passage Murphy highlighted.\n19: However, Casten made no call for impeachment in his Sun-Times response.\n20: And at several points during his 2018 campaign when he was asked where he came down on the issue, he stopped short of advocating for the House to take that course.\n21: Casten later called for an inquiry when such a move was beginning to gain traction among House Democrats .\n22: As a freshman Democrat who flipped a district held by Republicans for nearly five decades , he was one of the first vulnerable members of his party to take that stance.\n23: The House introduced two articles of impeachment against Trump on Dec. 10, 2019 .\n24: Those articles say Trump wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy related to the 2016 election.\n25: They also say Trump withheld security aid and a White House meeting to pressure Zelensky, then obstructed Congress to cover it up.\n26: On Dec. 12, Casten announced in a tweet he would vote in favor of impeachment.",

Dan Bishop and Donald Trump Jr. all repeating or retweeting versions of it.\n6: But when we asked a number of legal experts about what Kirk said, we found that their answer was unanimous: Kirk\u2019s claim is wrong.\n7: \"I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,\" said Heidi Kitrosser, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.\n8: Why Pelosi didn\u2019t violate the law See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Kirk cited the federal law Kirk mentioned and a Justice Department webpage summarizing it.\n9: \"Anything that comes out of the office of the president is a government document under the Presidential Records Act of 1978,\" the statement said.\n10: The statute in question deals with the \"concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\" of records and reports.\n11: It sets a penalty for anyone who \"conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys\" any government record \"filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.\"\n12: The statute also says that any person with \"custody\" of a government record cannot \"willfully and unlawfully\" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it.\n13: \"The point of the statute is to prevent people from destroying records in official repositories like the National Archives or in courts,\" said Georgetown Law professor Victoria Nourse.\n14: Pelosi is in the clear, experts said, because her copy of Trump\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t a government record.\n15: The State of the Union text was never \"filed or deposited\" with her, nor did she have \"custody\" of it in the legal sense.\n16: Video of the event shows that Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking, and Pelosi can be seen following along throughout.\n17: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com President Donald Trump hands copies of his State of the Union address to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence before delivering it to Congress on Feb. 4, 2020, in Washington.\n18: (AP/Semansky) \"Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,\" said Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws governing the preservation of government records.\n19: \"It is personal property.\"\n20: Under House rules , members of Congress are encouraged to preserve records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said.\n21: Unlike congressional committees , members are not legally required to hold onto their office\u2019s files.\n22: \"They can keep them private, they can destroy them, or they can rip them up,\" he said.\n23: This is in contrast to presidential records, which have been considered government property since the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and are supposed to be stored with the National Archives for safekeeping.\n24: \"The State of the Union is a presidential record, which must go to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act,\" Nourse said \"(Pelosi) did not mutilate the record that is filed with the Archives.\"\n25: The purpose of the records law \"is to prevent someone from depriving the government from the use of its documents,\" so Pelosi\u2019s move \"doesn\u2019t fit within the statute,\" added Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis.\n26: There are probably countless copies of Trump\u2019s address, such as the version the White House posted online.\n27: Pelosi\u2019s action doesn\u2019t preclude future generations from accessing one.\n28: \"If the statute were not read this way, then any copy of the State of the Union held by anyone could never be destroyed,\" Nourse said.\n29: For what it\u2019s worth, Trump has a habit of ripping up papers when he\u2019s done with them.\n30: According to Politico , staff members have had to tape Trump\u2019s shredded files together in order to send them to the Archives and avoid crossing the Presidential Records Act.",

Warren says with respect to real wages is frequently said by political leaders, but it is incorrect,\" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist.\n13: \"Real median earnings have been rising for more than a half decade, even if it may not feel that way to some wage earners whose wages have flatlined or even trended down over that period.\"",

        "passage": "0: With Democratic primary elections starting, a secretly recorded video is spreading misinformation about voter fraud.\n1: The video, uploaded to YouTube on Jan. 22, is titled \"LEAKED: DNC Group teaches ILLEGAL VOTING in Arizona.\"\n2: It shows two men pretending to be undocumented immigrants as they approach a Democratic activist at a Women\u2019s March rally in Phoenix, Ariz., on Jan. 19.\n3: The video caption reads: \"After asking the organization's co-founder, Richard Gooding, about how to vote as non-citizens, asking if they \u2018support illegals,\u2019 the staffer told our undercover journalists how they could sneak around voter laws and vote as non-citizens in federal elections!\"\n4: The video was flagged by VineSight , a company that uses artificial intelligence to flag misinformation on social media.\n5: We also found the video on Twitter and Facebook .\n6: The \"undercover journalists\" in the video, Joe Basrawi and Josh Aminov , are college students and conservative activists for Turning Point USA, a group that supports limited government and free markets.\n7: The YouTube video is similar to clips from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe.\n8: Project Veritas has a history of using undercover reporting , hidden cameras and selectively edited videos.\n9: With that in mind, we wanted to take a closer look at what was said during the video.\n10: We found that Gooding\u2019s comments were misconstrued to play into a common conspiracy theory about voter fraud.\n11: What Gooding said The shaky video lasts nearly four minutes.\n12: It shows a booth at an outdoor event.\n13: No one\u2019s face is visible.\n14: Over the course of the recording, Basrawi and Aminov repeatedly question Gooding about how they can vote illegally.\n15: At four points, Gooding tells them that they must be citizens to vote.\n16: Here\u2019s everything that Gooding, co-founder of the liberal grassroots organization AZ Blue 2020, said in response: Aminov: \"I like Democrat but I come here illegally.\n17: Can I register?\"\n18: Gooding: \"No, you can\u2019t.\"\n19: \u2026 Gooding: (to Basrawi) \"Are you registered to vote?\"\n20: Basrawi: \"No.\"\n21: Gooding: \"How old are you?\"\n22: Basrawi: \"21.\"\n23: Gooding: \"Are you a U.S.\n24: citizen?\"\n25: Basrawi: \"Not yet.\"\n26: Gooding: \"OK. Are you going to get your naturalization?\"\n27: Basrawi: \"Maybe.\n28: I don\u2019t know.\"\n29: Gooding: \"Well, when you do, if you do that, they actually have people there that will register you to vote, but you have to be a U.S. citizen and over 18.\"\n30: Basrawi: \"Oh.\"\n31: \u2026 Basrawi: \"I\u2019m from the Middle East.\n32: I came here to study.\"\n33: Gooding: \"Where at?\n34: Where are you at school?\"\n35: Basrawi: \"Over at ASU.\n36: I want to vote to get Trump out of office.\"\n37: Gooding: \"You have to get your citizenship to vote.\"\n38: Basrawi: \"I have to get my citizenship.\n39: There\u2019s no way for me to vote?\"\n40: Then the camera shuts off and is replaced by some distorted audio that claims to be the same interaction.\n41: In it, Gooding tells Basrawi and Aminov that, for them to vote, they\u2019d have to \"tell me you\u2019re a citizen when you\u2019re not.\"\n42: Gooding: \"You can go to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and ask them for a federal form because they don\u2019t verify your citizenship.\"\n43: Basrawi: \"And I can register to vote?\"\n44: Gooding: \"Yes, but you\u2019re going to have to check the box that says you\u2019re a citizen.\n45: I mean you would, and it\u2019s illegal, but \u2026\" When Basrawi and Aminov press him on the comment, asking if it\u2019s a \"big deal\" or if they would get deported, Gooding says: \"I have no idea.\"\n46: Aminov: \"I want to support party.\"\n47: Gooding: \"Yeah, I know.\n48: Really the best thing to do is to become a citizen.\"\n49: When the two men continue to press Gooding on the voter registration form, he clarifies.\n50: Aminov: \"Tuesday we can come, we register to vote and we don\u2019t need citizen.\"\n51: Gooding: \"Well, there\u2019s a federal form, and they don\u2019t check your citizenship.\n52: So you illegally registered to vote.\"\n53: Then the video shuts off again.\n54: AZ Blue 2020 The video is misleading on several fronts.\n55: First, AZ Blue 2020, the group that Gooding belongs to, is not part of the Democratic National Committee.\n56: A public Facebook group for AZ Blue 2020 describes itself as \"an independent organization of energized volunteers who want to make a difference.\n57: Our goal is to elect Democrats at every level to create a Democratic governance in Arizona by 2020.\"\n58: RELATED FACT-CHECK: Did 3 million undocumented immigrants vote in the 2016 election?\n59: The organization\u2019s mission is to \"empower and prepare the grassroots members of the Democratic Party, the Precinct committeepersons.\"\n60: Gooding told PolitiFact that AZ Blue 2020 does not have a connection to the DNC, which oversees the national efforts of the Democratic Party.\n61: \"We are a AZ State PAC and an Indivisible group,\" he said, referring to a progressive movement that launched after Trump\u2019s election.\n62: In a phone call, Basrawi conceded that AZ Blue 2020 is not a DNC group but stood by the video\u2019s assertion that Gooding was teaching \"illegal voting.\"\n63: Non-citizen voting in Arizona During the YouTube video, Gooding repeatedly told Aminov and Basrawi that, if they want to vote in the federal election, they should become citizens.\n64: He said it\u2019s illegal to register as a citizen if you\u2019re not.\n65: What Gooding was describing in the video about a federal form is an Arizona quirk: the state accepts voter registration forms from people who don\u2019t provide proof of citizenship, such as a valid driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, passport or naturalization documents.\n66: But they can only vote in federal elections, they have to attest to their citizenship when they register, and they must bring a valid photo ID to their polling place.\n67: \"A person is not required to submit proof of citizenship with the voter registration form, but failure to do so means the person will only be eligible to vote in federal elections (known as being a \u2018federal only\u2019 voter),\" the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s website reads .\n68: \"A \u2018federal only\u2019 voter will become eligible to vote a \u2018full ballot\u2019 in all federal, state, county and local elections if he or she later provides valid proof of citizenship to the appropriate County Recorder\u2019s office.\"\n69: If federal-only voters lie about their citizenship on Arizona\u2019s voter registration form , they are subject to prosecution, said C. Murphy Hebert, director of communications for the Arizona secretary of state.\n70: The federal voter registration form also asks about applicants\u2019 citizenship status.\n71: Respondents must check either yes or no, under penalty of perjury.\n72: RELATED: Report about potential Iowa voter fraud is false \"We never use the federal form and have never registered a voter using the federal voter registration form, because we could be registering non-citizens,\" Gooding told PolitiFact in an email.\n73: \"My error was sharing that information with those with an ulterior motive.\"\n74: Undocumented immigrants sometimes end up registered to vote after getting a driver\u2019s license or state ID card.\n75: The Arizona Republic has reported on efforts by state elections departments to verify voters\u2019 citizenship.\n76: Officials in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, told the newspaper that \"instances of non-citizens or undocumented immigrants attempting to register, let alone casting ballots, are extremely rare.\"\n77: According to a database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation, there have been 20 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Arizona dating back to 2009.",

        "passage": "0: In his third State of the Union address, President Trump claimed that since he took office:\u00a0\"7 million Americans have come off of food stamps and 10 million have been lifted off of welfare.\"\n1: There is some data to back him up when it comes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, but our analysis found that the data is flawed.\n2: In addition, we could not substantiate his claim that 10 million people have been lifted from welfare.\n3: SNAP figures are trending downward, but data is incomplete There are around 7 million fewer Americans participating in SNAP, sometimes called food stamps, than when Trump entered the White House, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.\n4: The program provides \"nutritional assistance\" to people with low incomes or disabilities.\n5: That\u2019s what the data shows, but there are some issues.\n6: The real number is likely a bit lower due to two things: A data reporting problem in North Carolina and a reporting discrepancy from the 2018-19 government shutdown.\n7: SNAP participation numbers by state show there are no North Carolina recipients being accounted for from October 2017 through all of 2019, dragging down the national average of recipients.\n8: (In 2018, the News and Observer reported that North Carolina's food stamp numbers were too good to be true.)\n9: During the winter 2019 government shutdown, the federal government asked states to issue double the amount of SNAP benefits in January so enrollees would not miss their\u00a0 February benefits if the shutdown continued.\n10: (It lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019.)\n11: Because of this, numbers for January 2019 are consistent with the number of people receiving food stamps in prior months.\n12: But February 2019\u2019s numbers show a huge drop, which also drags down the average.\n13: With all this being accounted for, the number of reductions may be closer to 6 million.\n14: Also, SNAP participation was falling since before Trump took office, a trend that experts say is likely due to a growing economy.\n15: Participation in the program usually follows along with the official poverty rate, which has been falling since 2010 .\n16: Meanwhile, the administration finalized a rule in late 2019 that tightens guidelines on who can receive benefits and for how long.\n17: The changes are expected to move more \"able-bodied\" adults into the workforce, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a news release .\n18: The rule was projected to end benefits for about 700,000 people.\n19: RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's 2020 State of the Union address Unclear where Trump derives his \u2018welfare\u2019 numbers Trump\u2019s claim that 10 million people were lifted \"off of welfare\" doesn\u2019t add up.\n20: We didn\u2019t hear back from the White House when we asked about this claim.\n21: One key problem is that \"welfare\" is an imprecise term.\n22: Besides SNAP, we reviewed the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and its Separate State Maintenance of Effort.\n23: Under TANF, the federal government provides a block grant to states, which use the funds to operate their own assistance programs.\n24: When Trump took office in January 2017, there were about 3.68 million recipients of these programs combined.\n25: In June 2019, that number dropped by about 825,000 to 2.85 million.\n26: The Center for Law and Social Policy , an advocacy organization for low-income people, told us it\u2019s hard to determine how Trump arrived at the 10 million number.\n27: Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of the organization\u2019s income and work supports team, said it couldn\u2019t be the TANF caseloads, as those numbers are much too low.\n28: \"It\u2019s possible the administration could get to 10 million by combining reductions in TANF with reductions in the use of Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), but we haven\u2019t seen any published data that show this figure,\" Lower-Basch wrote in an email.\n29: Most people think of \"welfare\" as a program for people who are not working, Lower-Basch said.\n30: In that respect, Medicaid, CHIP and SNAP don\u2019t necessarily fit into that category as the vast majority of people who are getting these types of benefits are children , seniors, or working adults .",

                "First, data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps, shows a downward trend; around 7 million fewer Americans are participating in SNAP since Trumpassumed presidency[3].",
                "However, this data has flaws and inconsistencies[1].",
                "SNAP participation has been falling even before Trump's inauguration, likely due to a growing economy[14], and the participation rate usually aligns with the official poverty rate, which has been decreasing since 2010[15].",
                "Certain states' figures, such as North Carolina, were not accounted for from October 2017 to 2019, which ostensibly drags down the national average of recipients[7].",
                "Additionally, a significant drop in SNAP\u2019s numbers was recorded in February 2019, resulting in a lower average[12].",
                "Considering these factors, the real reduction in SNAP participants could possibly be around 6 million, rather than the 7 million asserted by Trump[13][6].",
                "As for the claim of lifting 10 million people off welfare, the term \"welfare\" is ambiguous; this analysis considered federal programs alike SNAP and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.",
                "The total number of recipients for these programs declined by around 825,000 between January 2017 and June 2019, a figure considerably lower than the 10 million stated by Trump[24][25][22].",
                "Advocates at the Center for Law and Social Policy suggest reaching the cited number might involve counting reductions in other programs like Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, but there is no published data that corroborates this[28][26]."

George Harris's 1968 book Romney\u2019s Way quoted Romney saying to his \"reluctant white friends\": \"I think you ought to listen to Alinsky.\n29: It seems to me that we are always talking to the same people.\n30: Maybe the time has come to hear new voices,\" he said.",

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict President Donald Trump on an article of impeachment, he became a target of social media ire from Trump allies.\n1: One example is a Jan. 31 Facebook post by the Committee to Defend the President , a pro-Trump political action committee that says on its Facebook page, \"The Crooked Media has shown us time and time again that they can not be trusted, we will defend him!\"\n2: The post, which was shared about 8,000 times, features photographs of Romney and two former CIA officials, Joseph Cofer Black and John Brennan.\n3: It says: \"If you don\u2019t know who the guy in the middle (Black) is, you had better get up to speed, and fast.\n4: Joseph Cofer Black is Romney\u2019s national security advisor.\n5: He also currently sits on the board of Burisma holdings.\n6: JCB joined the CIA in 1974, and was the head of their counter-terrorism center during the 9/11 terror attacks.\n7: John Brennan was the CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia who approved the sketchy visas for the 9/11 attackers.\n8: He followed JCB as the head of CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism.\n9: And this is just scratching the surface of their relationships.\"\n10: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n11: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n12: We found that the post sprinkles a few facts \u2014 and a few erroneous assertions \u2014 into an unsupported claim.\n13: We\u2019ll take the elements one by one.\n14: Claim: \"Joseph Cofer Black is Romney\u2019s national security advisor.\"\n15: While Joseph Cofer Black has advised Romney in the past, he is not currently his \"national security advisor,\" Romney\u2019s office confirmed.\n16: Black served as director of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center from 1999 to 2002 and as U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism from 2002 to 2004.\n17: Since then, he\u2019s worked in the private sector, including a stint as vice chairman of Blackwater, a controversial security contractor.\n18: Black\u2019s relationship with Romney came primarily during Romney\u2019s two presidential campaigns.\n19: Black served as senior adviser for counterterrorism and national security on Romney's 2008 presidential campaign , then served as a special adviser for national security and foreign policy on Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign .\n20: The 2012 campaign team assembled dozens of foreign policy experts from the party, as is typical for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.\n21: Claim: Black \"currently sits on the board of Burisma holdings.\"\n22: This appears to be correct, according to the Ukranian energy company\u2019s website .\n23: When we checked it on Feb. 7, 2020, Black was listed as a director of the company.\n24: (The company\u2019s press office did not respond to an inquiry.)\n25: In fact, at one point, Black served on the board at the same time as Hunter Biden \u2014 the son of former Vice President Joe Biden who became a target of President Donald Trump and whose service on Burisma\u2019s board inspired the actions that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n26: Here\u2019s an archived version of the company\u2019s website in 2017, showing both Biden and Black.\n27: In a news release about Black\u2019s hiring in 2017, Black is quoted saying, \"I was impressed to learn that Burisma Group is the fastest-growing private gas producer in Central Europe.\n28: International projects where the Group is involved require a more thorough analysis and risk assessment, not only in terms of conventional risks \u2014 financial or political but also in terms of security.\"\n29: Claim: Black was the \"head\" of the CIA\u2019s \"counter-terrorism center during the 9/11 attacks.\"\n30: That\u2019s correct.\n31: As the Daily Beast noted in 2012, then-CIA chief George Tenet wrote that after the 9/11 attacks, Black insisted on staying at his office with his staff in a relatively exposed area of the CIA headquarters, rather than moving to a safer location.\n32: \"Well, they could die,\" Tenet recalls telling Black about his staff.\n33: Black responded, \"Well sir, then they are just going to have to die.\"\n34: Claim: \"John Brennan was the CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia who approved the sketchy visas for the 9/11 attackers.\"\n35: This is false.\n36: First, the CIA does not handle visas \u2014 the State Department does.\n37: The congressionally authorized 9/11 report went into detail about how each of the plot participants secured their visas.\n38: \"Individual consular officers (were) involved with the adjudication of visas to the hijackers,\" the report said .\n39: Second, during the time that Brennan was posted in Saudi Arabia, only a few of the visas were granted to the plotters (and not all of the terrorists got their visas in Saudi Arabia).\n40: Shortly after the plot quietly went into motion in 1999, President George W. Bush tapped Brennan to serve as chief of staff to Tenet at CIA headquarters, so Brennan was in the United States for most of the time the attack\u2019s planning was underway.\n41: He was named the CIA\u2019s deputy executive director in 2001, serving through 2003.\n42: \"He never approved a single U.S. visa,\" said Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for Brennan.\n43: Claim: Brennan followed Black \"as the head of CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism.\"\n44: This is false, although similar names have tripped up some non-experts.\n45: Black was head of the CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism center, commonly known as CTC, from 1999 to 2002.\n46: The center is a part of the CIA.\n47: Brennan, by contrast, was named by Bush as interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center, an inter-agency group under the umbrella of the Director of National Intelligence.\n48: Brennan served in the post from 2004 to 2005.\n49: Claim: Brennan has been close to Romney.\n50: This is ironic, since during the 2012 presidential campaign, Black was working on behalf of Romney, the Republican challenger, while Brennan was working in the administration\u00a0of the incumbent, President Barack Obama.\n51: The 2012 Daily Beast article specifically pairs the two as combatants.\n52: Black, the article said, was Romney\u2019s \"trusted man inside the intel community,\" while Brennan\u2019s role for Obama in the administration was \"so powerful that many senior spies complain that Brennan is the de facto CIA chief.\"\n53: (He would later be named CIA director by Obama.)\n54: \"I am not aware of any connection between Gov.\n55: Romney and John Brennan, nor can I imagine any, since Brennan was with Obama,\" Andrew Natsios, a professor at Texas A&M\u2019s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told PolitiFact.\n56: Natsios is also a former administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development who served on the same 2012 Romney advisory panel as Black did.\n57: That said, times have changed in the Trump era, as Brennan has praised Romney for his stance on impeachment.\n58: In October, Brennan tweeted , \"How many other Republican Senators are ready to show the courage, integrity, & principled position of Senator Romney?\n59: Thank you, Senator, for putting our Nation & our Constitution above party politics & the corrupt behavior of Donald Trump.\"\n60: The implication: Romney voted to convict Trump in order to protect Black.\n61: Foreign policy experts said it is unlikely that Romney was thinking of protecting an adviser from eight years ago when weighing one of the most important votes he would ever cast in the Senate.\n62: Romney laid out his reasoning for voting to convict in his widely noted Senate floor speech .\n63: \"Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president\u2019s counsel that a crime had been committed, the president\u2019s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit,\" Romney said.\n64: He continued: \"The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a \"high crime and misdemeanor.\n65: Yes, he did.\"\n66: The Committee to Defend the President did not respond to an inquiry for this article.",

        "claim": "\"\"Our new (health care) plans are up to 60% less expensive and better\"\" than Obamacare.\"",
        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: In his wide-ranging State of the Union address, President Donald Trump returned to a favorite theme: the cost of health insurance.\n1: He cited the high cost of premiums for people who buy their coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and said his administration has provided new, less costly coverage.\n2: \"I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives.\n3: Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better,\" Trump told the lawmakers gathered at the Capitol.\n4: So we wondered, to which new alternatives was he referring?\n5: We reached out to the White House to ask.\n6: Spokesperson Adam Kennedy responded that the president was talking about short-term, limited-duration plans.\n7: But that got us thinking: Are they really less expensive and better?\n8: Or simply better than nothing?\n9: First, are they new?\n10: They are not.\n11: As background, short-term insurance plans have been around for decades in various iterations and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school.\n12: They provide some protections, usually paying a percentage of hospital and doctor bills after the policyholder meets a deductible.\n13: But they\u2019ve always been a bit controversial.\n14: Unlike the ACA plans now available, short-term plans can bar people with health conditions from enrolling or exclude coverage for specific conditions or treatments.\n15: They also offer fewer benefits \u2014 meaning they are not required to comply with the health law\u2019s mandated essential benefits requirement.\n16: So, for example, they don\u2019t have to cover prescription drugs, or mental health services or substance abuse treatment \u2014 and many don\u2019t.\n17: In addition, they can set annual or lifetime caps on benefits.\n18: Almost all exclude maternity care.\n19: If a person develops a health condition during the coverage term, insurers can look through their medical records and, in some cases, retroactively cancel the plans \u2014 or refuse to renew the coverage at the end of the policy\u2019s term.\n20: The Obama administration restricted these policies, which still cannot be sold on the ACA marketplaces and do not qualify for subsidies, to a maximum coverage period of 90 days, down from the 364 days that applied previously.\n21: The Trump administration reversed that time-limit restriction in 2018 and built on it by allowing insurers to offer policies renewable for up to three years .\n22: Officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, said at the time that these short-term plans provide an alternative but aren\u2019t a good fit for everyone.\n23: For instance, the Trump rules require the policies to carry a warning that they aren\u2019t \"required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance.\"\n24: They also state that consumers should \"check the policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\"\n25: Are these plans less expensive?\n26: The White House pointed us toward a January 2019 report produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation as the source for the president\u2019s assertion that these plans are 60% less expensive.\n27: It quickly becomes clear that the analysis is very wonky and complex.\n28: After all, it\u2019s not easy to project what benefits insurers will include in short-term plans or what they will charge individuals, which can vary based on their health.\n29: Even the analysts called the estimating process \"challenging.\"\n30: When it came right down to it, they hedged: Short-term plans are likely cheaper than the lowest-cost ACA plan for some consumers, but more expensive for others.\n31: For example, people who get a federal tax credit to buy ACA-compliant insurance or those who are older or less healthy would likely pay more in premiums for a traditional short-term plan, the analysts said.\n32: Conversely, those without subsidies, especially younger or healthier consumers, might pay as much as 60% less than they would for the lowest-cost plan through the ACA, the analysis concluded.\n33: Another study, not cited by the White House but done by the conservative Manhattan Institute, also listed caveats, but more robustly defended the plans as less expensive.\n34: Premiums for short-term plans are lower \u2014 in some cases, almost half the cost \u2014 of ACA plans, it concluded.\n35: But critics put these price tags in context.\n36: \"I don\u2019t have a reason to suspect the 60% is wrong if they\u2019re lining them up against ACA plans, but if you\u2019re a health plan that doesn\u2019t cover much, it\u2019s easy enough to offer a cheap premium,\" said Sabrina Corlette, research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.\n37: So that gets to the question, are they better?\n38: The consensus is that the coverage short-term plans provide is not better than that of ACA plans.\n39: But it could be better than going without insurance entirely.\n40: \"Why not throw another option out there?\"\n41: said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the conservative Galen Institute.\n42: \"You might say this plan isn\u2019t as good as that plan, but we may both agree that having this one is better than nothing.\"\n43: He said that should be a decision made by consumers, who can weigh the pros and cons: \"They know their circumstances and risk tolerance.\".\n44: Still, it\u2019s a gamble, as no one knows what health conditions might befall them.\n45: A plan that doesn\u2019t cover prescription drugs may be fine the first month, but if a serious illness crops up, it suddenly has unexpected costs.\n46: Others also note that short-term plans may have wider networks of doctors and hospitals than some ACA plans, giving consumers more options.\n47: \"In Texas, for example, you cannot buy an ACA plan that covers MD Anderson,\" the cancer center of the University of Texas, said Brian Blase, CEO of Blase Policy Strategies.\n48: Blase has advised Trump on his health policy efforts.\n49: \"The only way you can have such a plan that includes MD Anderson \u2014 unless you have employer coverage \u2014 is in a short-term plan.\"\n50: Again, nice to have a wide network.\n51: But there\u2019s a conundrum.\n52: Someone with cancer \u2014 attracted to a network because it includes MD Anderson \u2014 would be rejected by most short-term plans.\n53: That ability to reject applicants \u2014 or seriously limit coverage of their preexisting conditions \u2014 helps keep premiums down.\n54: But those are also the main reasons experts say the plans are not better than those offered under the ACA, which bars such limits.\n55: A preexisting condition is often defined as anything treated \u2014 or for which a \"prudent person\" should have sought treatment \u2014 during the previous 12 months to five years, depending on the insurer.\n56: \"If you have high blood pressure and, while on one of these plans, you have a heart attack, the plan could say that was a preexisting condition,\" said Corlette.\n57: State regulation of such plans varies widely, as do the coverage benefits and limits offered by various insurers.\n58: Some have limits listed in the fine print.\n59: While short-term plans have been embraced by regulators in some states, nearly half of all states have moved to limit them to less than 12 months.\n60: Four \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York \u2014 have barred them altogether.\n61: Those states cite concerns about the effect on ACA premiums and the risk that consumers could be left hanging by the more limited nature of the short-term plans.",

Bush and Barack Obama, have seen relatives of high-ranking party leaders and administration officials in government positions.\n32: Foreign business and patents The image also takes aim at Eric and Donald Trump Jr. for their management of the Trump Organization, as well as at Ivanka Trump for her own business interests.\n33: In October 2019, Eric Trump said, \"When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.\"\n34: We rated that claim Pants on Fire .\n35: When Donald Trump became president, he transferred ownership of the Trump Organization to his sons and pledged that \"no new deals\" would be done during his time in office.\n36: But as we\u2019ve documented , the Trump sons have put almost no stops to their overseas business dealings.\n37: They have traveled the globe, managing properties and moving on deals they insist were signed or in-the-works before their father moved into the White House.\n38: Multiple news outlets and accountability groups have kept track of their international activities, and in some cases, the Trump children have publicly celebrated their endeavors.\n39: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com As for Ivanka Trump, it\u2019s misleading to say she\u2019s \"getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants.\"\n40: The president\u2019s daughter kept her international fashion business going for 18 months after her father\u2019s election before shutting it down.\n41: Amid trade talks with China in 2018, she received a number of trademarks from the country related to her products.\n42: She added more in 2019 , as well.\n43: Trademarks are slightly different from patents.\n44: According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , a trademark protects a symbol, logo, design, name or word meant to identify the person or company behind a product, while a patent protects a person or company\u2019s new invention.\n45: In May 2017, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced their pledge to contribute $100 million to a World Bank fund meant to help women entrepreneurs and small-business owners around the world, according to reports .\n46: The fund was Ivanka Trump\u2019s idea .\n47: But as Snopes noted , she does not have a hands-on role with the project, nor is she lining her pockets because of it.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: After his impeachment acquittal last week, President Donald Trump reminded Republicans of his importance to their success.\n1: Trump said during a press conference on Thursday that, with his help, Republicans could take back the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\n2: \"You know, in \u201918, we didn\u2019t win.\n3: We just won two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina, that were not supposed to be won,\" he said.\n4: A video of his speech is available on C-SPAN\u2019s website .\n5: Trump continued: \"But I went and I made speeches and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won, and we took two seats.\n6: Nobody writes about that.\n7: If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year.\"\n8: Trump didn\u2019t mention any other details about the races during his speech, but it\u2019s clear from context that he was referring to North Carolina\u2019s recent special elections.\n9: North Carolina last year held elections for two congressional seats: one in the 3rd District and the other in the 9th District.\n10: This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has boasted about his supposed influence on the 9th District race.\n11: Last year, Trump claimed that the Republican in the 9th District race, Dan Bishop, was \"down by 17\" points in the polls and then won \"by a lot.\"\n12: But the polls didn\u2019t support that statement and the final margin of the race was only 2 points, so PolitiFact rated his claim False .\n13: Trump\u2019s claim on Thursday was a little different.\n14: He referred to both races, and was speaking more generally about who was expected to win.\n15: So is it true that Republicans were underdogs in those races?\n16: No.\n17: Let\u2019s look at the races, one by one.\n18: The 9th District The 9th District race featured Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready.\n19: Background: The election was a do-over of the November 2018 contest, when Republican Mark Harris appeared to defeat McCready.\n20: But an investigation into the results found absentee ballot fraud, and the alleged leader of the ballot scheme worked for the Harris campaign.\n21: So the State Board of Elections called a new election, and Harris dropped out.\n22: About the district: The 9th District was home to more registered Democrats than Republicans, said Michael Bitzer, a history and politics professor at Catawba College.\n23: About 36 percent of registered voters are Democrats, 32 percent are unaffiliated and 31 percent are Republicans.\n24: But that doesn\u2019t mean the district favored Democrats.\n25: \"While it may seem that party registration favored Democrats, a significant portion of those registered Democrats are in rural counties, which means that they are more likely to be Republican voters,\" Bitzer said.\n26: Indeed, no Democrat had won the seat since 1963, according to the Charlotte Observer .\n27: \"Polls showed a tight race due to the Democratic-leaning national environment and Dan McCready's strength as a candidate,\" said Drew Savicki, a freelance political analyst who has written for the Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball political blog .\n28: But, Savicki added: Trump in 2016 won the district by 12 points, and \"Democrats only hold a few seats redder than that.\"\n29: Polls and predictions: It\u2019s true that some polls showed McCready with a lead.\n30: But some polls showed Bishop with a lead.\n31: The website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the polling of the district.\n32: As we\u2019ve previously reported, the most favorable public poll for McCready had him up 5 points and most favorable poll for Bishop showed him up 4 points.\n33: Most experts considered the Democrat\u2019s chance to be 50-50, at best.\n34: Kyle Kondik of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball considered the race a \" toss-up ,\" while Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report wrote that a McCready win would be \"an upset.\"\n35: The 3rd District The 3rd District race featured Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas -- and wasn\u2019t nearly as close as the 9th District race.\n36: Background: The special election was ordered after the death of longtime Congressman Walter Jones, a Republican.\n37: He had represented the district for more than 24 years .\n38: About the district: Voter registration favored Republicans, who had 34 percent of the population to the Democrats\u2019 32 percent, Bitzer said.\n39: In 2016, Jones won with 67 percent of the vote, and Trump carried the district by 23 percent.\n40: So the race between Thomas and Murphy wasn\u2019t considered competitive.\n41: \"No version of the 3rd district has backed a Democrat for President since Carter in 1980,\" Savicki said.\n42: Polls and predictions: The only poll documented on FiveThirtyEight showed Murphy up by 11 percent.\n43: Sabato\u2019s blog said the race leaned Republican.\n44: And Bitzer said in an email: \"I can\u2019t recall any handicapper or political analyst ever thinking that the NC 3rd was in danger of going to Democratic.\"\n45: PolitiFact reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign about his claim, but didn\u2019t hear back.\n46: \"To say that Republicans were not likely to win either of those seats makes it sound like analysts had both seats rated as Democratic-likely elections,\" Bitzer said.\n47: \"To my knowledge, there was no data or polling that would have indicated that scenario.\"",

        "passage": "0: U.S. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-5th, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majority in the General Assembly of embracing liberal policies that are out of sync with Virginia.\n1: Democrats last fall won control of both legislative chambers for the first time this century.\n2: Riggleman, during a Jan. 23 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show, said the party has gone \"absolutely loco\" in passing gun control bills, proposing a gas tax hike to improve roads and backing measures he said will hurt small businesses.\n3: He said Democrats could be facing the \"shortest tenure ever for a majority, based on the craziness coming out of the state legislature.\"\n4: He added, \"Over 50% of the people now in the House and the state Senate have not been born in Virginia.\n5: And most of them, completely new.\n6: They\u2019re not even Virginians by grace yet.\"\n7: We fact-checked Riggleman\u2019s statistic.\n8: We\u2019ll leave it to you to determine what, if anything, qualifies a person to be a \"Virginian by grace.\"\n9: The numbers To learn where lawmakers were born, we consulted their\u00a0 biographies on the House and Senate websites and in General Assembly manuals.\n10: In a few cases, we turned to newspaper stories or asked legislative aides.\n11: The newly-elected House of Delegates sworn in last month has 52 members born outside Virginia and 48 born inside the state.\n12: The newly-elected Senate has 22 members born outside the state and 18 born within.\n13: Combining the chambers, 74 legislators were born outside Virginia, 66 inside.\n14: That\u2019s a flip from 2019, when Republicans held narrow majorities in both chambers.\n15: In the House 52 delegates were born in Virginia, 48 weren\u2019t.\n16: In the Senate, 22 were born in Virginia, 18 were not.\n17: Combing the chambers, 74 lawmakers were born inside Virginia, 66 outside.\n18: In other words, there was a net addition in both chambers of four members born outside the state.\n19: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But these numbers are tricky and don\u2019t suggest - as Riggleman implies - that those born outside Virginia are alien to its culture.\n20: Nine current General Assembly members (six senators and three delegates) listed as being born out of state were delivered across the Potomac River in Washington D.C. Their biographies show six of them (four senators and two delegates) graduated from high school or college in Virginia.\n21: If counted, Riggleman\u2019s claim about out-of-state majorities would fall.\n22: Twelve other legislators were born in states bordering Virginia: North Carolina; Maryland; West Virginia; Kentucky; and Tennessee.\n23: Republican Del.\n24: Terry Kilgore, for example, has lived in Gate City in Southwest Virginia for all of his life, except when he attended college and law school in other parts of Virginia.\n25: But he was born in a hospital 20 miles away in Kingsport, Tenn. and - in Riggleman\u2019s claim - doesn\u2019t count as a native-born Virginian.\n26: Demographics So far, we\u2019ve been focusing on the details of numbers between 2019 and 2020 and, by strict count, there has been a transition to where a majority of General Assembly members were born out of Virginia.\n27: But a broader trend emerges if we use 1960 as our starting point.\n28: The increase in non-Virginia legislators over the past 60 years reflects the increase in non-native-born Virginians living in the state.\n29: In 1960, Virginia was in the final years of domination by a political machine controlled by Democratic U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd that was rural in origin and segregationist.\n30: The House of Delegates had 96 Democrats and four Republicans; the Senate had 38 Democrats and two Republicans.\n31: Eighty-five percent of the legislators were born in Virginia, as was 71% of the state\u2019s population.\n32: These days, Virginia\u2019s politics are dominated by a suburban crescent arching from Northern Virginia through Hampton Roads.\n33: There\u2019s been a large migration to the state through these suburbs - particularly Northern Virginia - by a professional class of government workers and contractors.\n34: The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 50.5% of the state\u2019s population in 2018 was born outside Virginia.\n35: That nearly matches the 52% of legislators this year who were not born in Virginia.\n36: \"People like to vote for people who reflect them,\" said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.\n37: \"These legislators reflect the people they represent.\n38: Riggleman\u2019s living in the past.\"\n39: \"We\u2019ve become a different state,\" said Bob Holsworth, a political scientist and consultant.\n40: \"I certainly understand some people who regret that some of the traditions have gone by, but in terms of overall prospects (offered by Virginia), there\u2019s a big difference between now and 65 years ago.\"\n41: By the way Although it\u2019s not part of fact-check rating, we took a quick look at\u00a0 Riggleman\u2019s contention that most of the out-of-state legislators were elected last year.\n42: He\u2019s wrong.\n43: Only nine of the 52 non-Virginia born delegates were elected last fall, as were only five of the 22 senators born out of state.",

        "passage": "0: Gov.\n1: Tony Evers has run into a Republican buzzsaw in attempting to get many of his policies through the state Legislature.\n2: But he still identified plenty of progress to celebrate in his latest State of the State speech.\n3: He touted changes in education, transportation and healthcare, then circled back to an earlier pledge on taxes.\n4: \"I delivered on my campaign promise for a 10% tax cut for Wisconsin families,\" he said Jan. 22, 2020, in the annual address.\n5: We\u2019ll need to look back at his promise and forward at tax projections to see if that\u2019s the case.\n6: Here we go.\n7: The promise Evers\u2019 speech didn\u2019t go into much detail on the nature of that tax cut, but he was quite specific in 2018 on the campaign trail.\n8: A news release from his campaign on Oct. 14, 2018, described it this way: Under Evers\u2019 plan, everyone with annual incomes up to $100,000 would receive a 10% tax cut.\n9: Evers would also provide the tax cut to families making up to $150,000.\n10: Altogether, this cut would reach approximately 86% of tax filers.\n11: That news release remained on Evers\u2019 campaign website as of late 2019 but has been removed.\n12: A copy is still accessible through archive.org .\n13: Regardless, that gives us a firm benchmark to examine Evers\u2019 claim that he \"delivered\" on that promise.\n14: The reality When asked for evidence of Evers\u2019 claim, spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff pointed to Wisconsin Department of Revenue projections for the 2020 tax year .\n15: The agency generated projected tax impacts for each income bracket based on the policies written into law through the budget and an accompanying bill (Acts 9 and 10).\n16: Department of Revenue spokeswoman Patty Mayers noted these are estimates that can change, but they are the best existing projections for the tax changes passed under Evers.\n17: Baldauff highlighted estimates for married filers with incomes between $30,000 and $60,000.\n18: Each of the three income brackets in that range are projected to see tax cuts of 10% or more.\n19: But Evers promised a tax cut to all families with an income of $150,000 or less, and the full Department of Revenue projections show tax brackets under and over that amount fell well short of that 10% mark.\n20: Across all income brackets under $150,000, the changes from Acts 9 and 10 generate an average tax cut of 4.9% for married filers who owe taxes \u2014 half of what Evers promised.\n21: That works out to about $129 per tax return.\n22: If you look at the impact in terms of people, about one-fourth of married filers will see the promised cut of 10% or more, according to the Department of Revenue projections.\n23: That\u2019s among the group that owe some amount of taxes and fall in the under-$150,000 bracket Evers referenced.\n24: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Baldauff asserted Evers always intended to focus his 10% tax cut on \"middle-class\" families, meaning the 10% tax cut in the $30,000 to $60,000 fulfilled his promise.\n25: But neither his original pledge nor his wording in the State of the State reflected that.\n26: In any case, the definition of middle-class offered by Baldauff doesn\u2019t make much sense in a state where the median family income is about $59,000.\n27: Her range only goes down from the median, not up.\n28: We should also note that we\u2019ve visited this topic before with our Evers-O-Meter, which tracks promises Evers made while seeking the state\u2019s highest office.\n29: In July 2019, we rated a promise to cut middle class taxes by 10% as a Compromise, since initial projections showed Evers\u2019 proposed tax break was cut roughly in half by the Republican Legislature.\n30: That\u2019s in line with the updated projections.\n31: Same story for single filers We focused on married filers since Evers\u2019 speech referred to families, but we should note he also promised a 10% tax cut to \"everyone\" filing an individual tax return with an income of $100,000 or less.\n32: The latest projections for single filers show a similar trend to the married filers in 2020.\n33: Those with incomes of $20,000 to $40,000 are expected to see a tax cut of more than 10%, but the reduction is noticeably less for the income brackets above and below that.\n34: Overall, single filers with incomes below $100,000 are projected to see an average tax cut of 6.7% under Acts 9 and 10.",

screenshot is an entry for another envelope protein associated with the \"Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus.\"\n25: It was submitted Jan. 5 by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health at Fudan University.\n26: RELATED: PolitiFact\u2019s coronavirus coverage in one place The Hal Turner Radio Show compared the two viral proteins using a NCBI search and found that the two were nearly identical.\n27: But there are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans\u00a0and they have similar envelope proteins .\n28: So the match doesn\u2019t prove the two viruses are the same.\n29: \"The family of coronaviruses are going to be highly related, just because they are in the same family,\" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, in an email.\n30: We ran the same NCBI search as the Hal Turner Radio Show and found 78 entries with envelope proteins similar to the 2019 coronavirus.\n31: Bioweapon theory is unfounded The second claim in the Hal Turner Radio Show\u2019s article is that, since Chinese researchers uploaded its genetic information, the 2019 coronavirus is a military bioweapon.\n32: That\u2019s unproven.\n33: There is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens \u2014 and some have linked it to China\u2019s biological warfare program.\n34: The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China\u2019s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.\n35: Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak.\n36: In its most recent situation summary , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus.\n37: Their findings suggest \"a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.\"\n38: The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to 24 countries.\n39: Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human.\n40: RELATED: No evidence that Chinese officials will say coronavirus was leaked from a lab There\u2019s no evidence that the coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon.\n41: And even if there were, Watanabe said it\u2019s highly unlikely the Chinese military would have uploaded the genetic sequence to a public database maintained by an American government agency.\n42: \"China, like the other countries including the U.S., have legitimate biomedical research going on at military facilities,\" Watanabe said.\n43: \"Just because they uploaded information, doesn\u2019t make it a bioweapon.\"",

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: In the Democrats\u2019 Spanish-language response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso said the president and his allies are \"the biggest threat to our safety and security\" because they are \"unwilling to take action for our country, acting solely in their own interest.\"\n1: She went on to highlight the actions of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, is openly stonewalling legislation that would help improve the lives of veterans, women, and families \u2013 all of us,\" Escobar said, according to an English language translation of her remarks provided by her office.\n2: \"House Democrats have passed more than 275 bipartisan bills this Congress, but these bills are gathering dust on his desk.\"\n3: Michigan Gov.\n4: Gretchen Whitmer, who delivered the Democratic Party\u2019s response in English after the State of the Union, cited similar figures when discussing McConnell\u2019s actions: \"Those three bills, and more than 275 other bipartisan bills, are just gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s desk.\"\n5: The New York Times called Whitmer\u2019s claim \"exaggerated,\" based on an analysis from Factcheck.org of a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0making the same claim .\n6: Escobar\u2019s office shared a list of 291 \"bipartisan\" bills that were approved by the House since the beginning of 2019 but are awaiting action in the Senate, as of Jan. 24.\n7: Let\u2019s dive in.\n8: No universal definition of \u2018bipartisan\u2019 Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval, spokeswoman for Escobar, said Escobar considered bills as being bipartisan if there was \"at least one Republican vote on the House floor,\" or if the bill was passed by a voice vote and \"has at least one Republican cosponsor.\"\n9: \"Bills that passed on voice vote but do not have at least one Republican cosponsor were excluded,\" she said.\n10: While there is no singular definition of what constitutes a bipartisan bill, the four political experts we consulted for this piece generally agreed that Escobar used a low bar by which to judge cooperation between political parties.\n11: Kirby Goidel, director of the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A&M University, said the term \"bipartisan\" has taken on a looser definition in regular usage because it is \"advantageous in terms of public support.\"\n12: \"It is not unusual to call a bill bipartisan when it only received a single vote from across the aisle, though that runs against our more general understanding of what the term is intended to mean,\" he said in an email.\n13: \"It is also easy to imagine individual representatives more willing to compromise because they are Republican representing a Democratic district (or vice versa), so adding one member of the opposition in that context wouldn't strike anyone as \u2018bipartisan\u2019.\"\n14: As an example, he added: \"(U.S. Sen. Mitt) Romney's vote didn't make the vote for impeachment bipartisan.\"\n15: Goidel said a better definition for bipartisan would be legislation that has \"majority support from both parties.\"\n16: \"Though ideally we wouldn't include resolutions or other items that generate little or no opposition, because the term also implies that the parties worked together to compromise on an important and potentially controversial issue,\" he said.\n17: For the purposes of this fact-check, we\u2019ll rely on counting the votes, since it is tricky to gauge how much collaboration went into each proposal behind the scenes.\n18: Jordan Tama, associate professor at American University who is writing a book about bipartisanship, said it is \"less common\" to see a truly bipartisan process in today\u2019s Congress, since members tend to develop legislation within their own party and only look to attract support from the other party after the fact.\n19: \"It is more common to see bipartisanship reflected in voting outcomes, even though in many of these cases the legislation wasn\u2019t developed in a very bipartisan method,\" Tama said.\n20: \"You can still call something bipartisan if the votes show support from both parties, even if it wasn\u2019t developed through a highly collaborative process.\"\n21: Members of both parties tend to make claims about bipartisanship based on support from one member of the other party, according to Laura Blessing, senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute.\n22: \"Everybody does this,\" she said.\n23: \"This is strategic messaging to a larger audience about the nature of legislation and values of main sponsors in reaching across the aisle, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is a meaningless standard.\n24: \"There is a spectrum about how we think of measures of bipartisanship, and if these people want to use this, well, people have done this before and they\u2019ll do it again.\n25: It is a reasonable standard, but there are higher ones out there.\"\n26: Adding up the numbers When a bill comes before the full House, there are two primary ways the legislative body votes: a roll call vote or a voice vote.\n27: In a roll call vote, the names of each legislator are read aloud and their vote is recorded alongside their name.\n28: When the body passes a measure in a voice vote, members call out \"aye\" or \"nay\" on the question of passage and the presiding officer decides which side prevailed.\n29: If there is a dispute over the decision, members stand to get an exact tally of the vote.\n30: Of the 291 bills Escobar\u2019s team marked as bipartisan, 116 passed in a roll call vote and 175 passed by a voice vote.\n31: Before we get into the votes, here\u2019s a reminder about the party breakdown in the House.\n32: There are 232 Democrats, 197 Republicans and one independent.\n33: Five seats are vacant.\n34: Let\u2019s start with the 116 roll call votes: 71 passed with the support of a majority of Republican members of the House, ranging from 100 votes to 196 votes.\n35: Seven bills passed with anywhere from 55 to 93 GOP votes, and 38 passed with fewer than 50 Republican votes \u2014 23 of which passed with fewer than 10 Republican votes.\n36: Escobar\u2019s team flagged 175 bills that passed via a voice vote and have at least one Republican co-sponsor.\n37: Of those, 63 have Republican sponsors, meaning a Republican introduced the bill, and at least one Democrat as a co-sponsor.\n38: Looking at the 112 bills with a Democrat as the sponsor, five have more than 50 Republican co-sponsors and the rest have 32 or fewer Republican co-sponsors.\n39: Of those, 95 have fewer than 10 Republican co-sponsors.\n40: Tama said he didn\u2019t think it was worth it to split hairs over sponsorships on bills that passed by a voice vote, since that generally indicates that there is support for the bill from both parties.\n41: \"You can really only use (a voice vote) when the vast majority of members are going to vote for it,\" he said.\n42: \"If you imagine a vote where two parties are polarized, you\u2019d have almost as many voting yes and no \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be able to judge the outcome.\n43: I think it is safe to say that all of the voice votes involved bipartisan support, even if we can\u2019t know for sure what the result is.\"\n44: Overall, the experts we consulted agreed that, given the various definitions of bipartisan, Escobar\u2019s claim was largely accurate but could use more clarifying details.\n45: Sean Theriault, a government professor at the University of Texas, said her use of the term bipartisan is fair.\n46: \"It\u2019s certainly not telling the whole truth, but a single vote from the other side does indicate that it enjoys support from both parties,\" he said in an email.\n47: \"So, of course, we would prefer Escobar to say, \u2018275 bills that have received at least support from one Republican are sitting on McConnell\u2019s desk,\u2019 but calling them \u2018bipartisan\u2019 is not wrong.\"",

        "passage": "0: During the Feb. 7 Democratic presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden once again questioned the price tag of \"Medicare for All,\" the single-payer health care proposal championed by one of his key rivals, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n1: Biden argued that the plan was fiscally irresponsible and would require raising middle-class taxes.\n2: Specifically, he claimed, the plan \"would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now.\"\n3: Medicare for All\u2019s price \u2014 and whether it\u2019s worth it \u2015 is a subject of fierce discussion among Democratic presidential candidates.\n4: But we had never heard this figure before.\n5: It caught our attention, so we decided to dig in.\n6: Biden\u2019s campaign directed us to the 2018 federal budget, which totaled $4.1 trillion.\n7: It compared that amount to the estimated cost of Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal: between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade.\n8: The math, they said, shows Medicare for All would cost more than the national budget.\n9: But it turns out, based on the numbers and interviews with independent experts, Biden\u2019s comparison of Medicare for All\u2019s price to total federal spending misses the mark because the calculation is flawed.\n10: The numbers Sanders has said publicly that economists estimate Medicare for All would cost somewhere between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over 10 years.\n11: Research by the nonpartisan Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. think tank, puts the figure in the $32 trillion to $34 trillion range.\n12: We pointed out to Biden\u2019s campaign that comparing 10-year spending estimates to one-year budgets is like comparing apples to oranges.\n13: The campaign suggested that if you take 10 times the current federal budget, you get a figure smaller than the estimated cost of Medicare for All over that 10-year window.\n14: That calculation would lead you to multiply $4.1 trillion by 10 to get $41.1 trillion.\n15: That result is close to the high mark Sanders set for his program\u2019s cost but well above the $34 trillion that Urban researchers projected.\n16: Still, that\u2019s not the correct way to formulate a comparison, experts say.\n17: \"That\u2019s not good math,\" said Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n18: \"That\u2019s taking a 2018 number, and multiplying it by 10, whereas the $34 trillion is a 10-year number that assumes a lot of growth.\"\n19: What you would need to do is add up the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projected budget outlays from 2020 to 2029, and compare the sum to the Medicare for All spending figure.\n20: So we spoke to Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at Urban\u2019s Health Policy Center, who arrived at the $34 trillion estimate.\n21: She ran the CBO\u2019s numbers: The next 10 years of on-budget outlay, the government office projects, add up to $44.8 trillion.\n22: To be clear, $34 trillion (34 followed by 12 zeros) is no small sum.\n23: It accounts for about 75% of that nearly $45 trillion budget estimate and would represent a bigger single increase to the federal budget than we\u2019ve ever experienced, Blumberg said.\n24: That raises one point on which Biden may have some ground.\n25: Goldwein argued that you would indeed need significant tax increases to finance the Sanders proposal.\n26: But its price tag still would be less than the projected budget.\n27: \"If he said [Medicare for All] was as big as the current federal budget, that would be incorrect,\" Blumberg said.\n28: Goldwein looked at the numbers another way: Including interest, he found, the federal budget would consume about $55 trillion between now and 2030.\n29: Again, that\u2019s more than what Medicare for All would cost during the same period.\n30: Big picture: No matter how you slice Biden\u2019s math, his numbers are off.\n31: \"If what he said was Medicare for All will cost as much as the entire rest of the budget, that would be fair,\" Goldwein said.\n32: But that\u2019s not the same thing.",

John Nygren , chairman of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, said Jan. 22, 2020 on Twitter and in a later news release .\n7: \"No amount of rhetoric can cover his failed record of putting rural Wisconsin and our farmer(s) behind liberal special interests.\"\n8: The budget claims from the Marinette Republican caught our eye.\n9: Did Evers really try to raise taxes on agriculture to fund welfare?\n10: Agriculture affected, but not directly Defending Nygren\u2019s claim, his chief of staff Nathan Schwanz pointed to proposed changes to the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit.\n11: Evers\u2019 budget explicitly changed only half of that credit.\n12: He proposed limiting the credit for manufacturing to $300,000 per tax year.\n13: But the budget added, \"The Governor also recommends leaving the agricultural portion of the credit unchanged compared to current law.\"\n14: The changes would have reduced the tax credit \u2014 i.e.\n15: raised taxes \u2014 by a total of $289 million in 2020 and $237 million in 2021.\n16: Schwanz said the proposed cut still would have been a blow to agriculture, however, pointing to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo from February 2019.\n17: The nonpartisan agency, responding to a request from Nygren, found about 25% of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credits in 2018-19 went to manufacturers \"where agricultural products are the primary input.\"\n18: Those were manufacturers of food, beverages, tobacco and basic chemicals.\n19: So Evers didn\u2019t propose any direct tax increases to agriculture, but his proposed changes for manufacturers would have reduced their income.\n20: Nygren\u2019s argument is that would have then affected agricultural producers by limiting the amount of product manufacturers took in.\n21: Budget dynamics a factor in claim Nygren also connected these cuts to welfare.\n22: Evers\u2019 proposed budget increased spending for welfare programs, so Schwanz said the proposed cuts to the manufacturing and agriculture credit were among the changes needed to offset that.\n23: He summed up the logic this way: \"There is no doubt that the Governor\u2019s budget increased General Fund taxes.\n24: There is no doubt that his budget expanded welfare and that these tax increases were needed to pay for it.\"\n25: So there\u2019s no direct link between the manufacturing tax credit and welfare.\n26: That is, Evers didn\u2019t propose earmarking the credit savings for a welfare program.\n27: But broadly speaking, a cut in one area does affect the ability to increase spending in another.\n28: The manufacturing tax credit is paid from the General Fund, which is used for all manner of welfare programs.\n29: It\u2019s an approach to budgeting that is used by fiscal bureau analysts and others, including Evers.\n30: For example, in his 2017 annual education address, Evers, then the schools superintendent, said, \"Every dollar we shift from the state coffers to pay for roads, and increasingly, to simply pay for debt, is a dollar we move out of the classroom of a child,\" the Wisconsin State Journal reported in a Sept. 22, 2017 article.",

        "passage": "0: During a House committee hearing on President Donald Trump\u2019s budget proposal, U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky questioned the White House\u2019s acting budget director on major cuts Trump\u2019s plan would make to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n1: \"Does this budget propose cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency?\"\n2: Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, asked Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.\n3: \"It proposes a cut to EPA by about 26% and we believe that we will still be able to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of clean air, clean water, clean \u2014\" Vought said, before Schakowsky interjected with a claim that caught our attention: \"We\u2019ve also seen in the time that he\u2019s been president, an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way,\" she said.\n4: In 2018, PolitiFact rated Half True a claim from Trump\u2019s EPA that greenhouse emissions were down under the president, finding that while emissions were continuing to fall, the rate of decline had slowed during Trump\u2019s first year in office.\n5: The data at that time did not show emissions were rising.\n6: So we wanted to find out whether more recent figures support Schakowsky\u2019s claim that emissions have increased under Trump, and whether the changes suggest a trend going \"in the wrong way.\"\n7: Overall, emissions are indeed up from 2016 levels following a spike in 2018.\n8: After that, carbon emissions again began to decline.\n9: Experts interviewed say those incremental changes may have nothing to do with Trump policies.\n10: A sharp rise, followed by another drop In response to our inquiry, a spokesman for Schakowsky\u2019s office pointed to reports highlighting a 2018 spike in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions following three years of declines.\n11: A report published in May 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose 2.7% in 2018.\n12: It was the second-largest annual increase since 2000, the group reported, though somewhat smaller than an estimate it made earlier in the year based on preliminary data.\n13: The largest increase occurred in 2010 under then-President Barack Obama as the economy began its rebound from the recession, according to the group.\n14: In a draft report released this month, the EPA noted a similar uptick in 2018 CO2 emissions, which comprise the vast majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n15: So Schakowsky is correct there was a spike in carbon emissions on Trump\u2019s watch.\n16: In 2019, however, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell again, according to several recent international reports .\n17: And that drop was not a surprise.\n18: Indeed, the preliminary Rhodium report for 2018 noted that while the pace of U.S. emissions decline had slowed since 2016, the group did not \"expect a repeat\" increase the following year.\n19: To address that point, Schakowsky\u2019s office sent us a Scientific American article speculating the decline identified in one of the international reports could be \"overly optimistic\" and a Washington Post story highlighting the Rhodium Group\u2019s lukewarm preliminary findings for U.S. emissions in 2019.\n20: While a significant decline in coal consumption last year helped drive the overall drop, Rhodium noted, the United States made little progress in other areas.\n21: By their accounting, net greenhouse gas emissions remained slightly higher in 2019 than at the end of 2016.\n22: \"There are low-cost technology solutions to reduce oil and gas methane emissions,\" the Rhodium report said.\n23: \"But their deployment at scale requires strengthening regulations that the Trump Administration instead has been weakening.\"\n24: It\u2019s also worth noting Rhodium did not attribute any of the emissions changes seen so far to the Trump administration, which has made eliminating federal environmental regulations a priority.\n25: Instead, both Rhodium and the federal government pegged the 2018 increase to fluctuations in weather, which drove up heating and cooling needs, and to increased economic growth.\n26: \"Overall there has indeed been an increase (or at best little or no change) in carbon emissions since Trump has been president,\" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a climatologist at Texas A&M University, in an email response.\n27: \"Whether Trump\u2019s policies have had any significant positive or negative effect on U.S. carbon emissions is a separate question.\"",

Bernie Sanders welcomed Democratic rival Mike Bloomberg into the thick of the presidential primary with a slew of attacks on the former New York City mayor\u2019s moderate record.\n1: Speaking at a gathering of Democrats in Nevada, Sanders contrasted his own consistent support for raising the minimum wage with Bloomberg\u2019s on-the-record opposition.\n2: \"We will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who in 2015 stated, and I quote: \u2018I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,\u2019\" Sanders said .\n3: We wondered if that was true, and it is.\n4: It\u2019s worth clarifying that this is no longer Bloomberg\u2019s position in 2020 .\n5: Bloomberg supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, up from $7.25, putting him in line with the rest of his primary opponents .\n6: RELATED: Who led the way for a $15 minimum wage in New York?\n7: RELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on a $15 minimum wage Bloomberg preferred tax credit to wage hike In 2015, Bloomberg spoke against raising the minimum wage : \"I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,\" Bloomberg said on the Bloomberg TV channel .\n8: (Sanders quoted him accurately.)\n9: Bloomberg went on to describe what he would support: raising the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n10: Doing so, he said, would reduce the burden on employers and protect jobs.\n11: \"I think you should raise the income tax credit, which does the same thing for the same people, but it spreads the burden across all the taxpayers rather than just a small number of businesspeople whose inclination would be to cut back employment.\n12: Earned Income Tax Credit doesn\u2019t get anybody to cut back, it gets them to hire more people.\"\n13: The federal Earned Income Tax Credit reduces taxes for low- and moderate-income working people.\n14: About 29 states have passed their own earned-income tax credit.\n15: While mayor in 2004, Bloomberg signed legislation starting a local tax credit .\n16: In 2018, Bloomberg again called for using the tax credit rather than hiking the minimum wage.\n17: During an interview with Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, he repeated his concern that a hike in the minimum wage would lead to job losses.\n18: (The Congressional Budget Office has found far more people would receive wage hikes than likely lose their jobs under a national increase to $15 an hour.)\n19: Bloomberg\u2019s support for the tax credit rather than a rise in the minimum wage is shared by some experts .\n20: However, others say the two policies can work in tandem , and both could help poor workers.\n21: While Bloomberg spoke broadly against a minimum wage increase, in 2012 he did support raising the minimum wage in New York to $8.25 an hour.\n22: Also, Bloomberg had a mixed record on living-wage proposals to lift wages of certain workers who were employed by entities that had city contracts.\n23: When Bloomberg opposed such measures, he raised concerns about the cost for the city or the impact on economic development .\n24: Bloomberg now supports $15 minimum wage During his 2020 campaign for president , Bloomberg has called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n25: He also calls for enhancing the tax credit.\n26: Bloomberg\u2019s labor plan says he will sign the Raise the Wage Act , which would raise the minimum wage gradually over six years to $15 an hour.\n27: The bill passed the House in July 2019 and has not had a vote in the Senate.\n28: The Bloomberg campaign did not explain the change of position.\n29: Bloomberg has not publicly addressed it, as far as we can tell.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for instance, distributed talking points that zeroed in on fundraising, saying \"Pete Buttigieg is a favorite candidate of Wall Street and the health care industry.\"\n2: The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., already faced criticism over his \"billionaire donors,\" which famously manifested during the Dec. 19 Democratic debate.\n3: It was then that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., described a Buttigieg fundraiser as held in \"a wine cave full of crystals.\"\n4: Sanders\u2019 comments led us to wonder if Buttigieg really is the sweetheart of the health care industry.\n5: We asked the Sanders campaign for its evidence.\n6: Staffers pointed us to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that operates the website OpenSecrets.org and tracks money from individuals and political action committees donated to political candidates and members of Congress.\n7: The center analyzes Federal Election Commission data and sorts contributions by categories based on the economic sector from which they come.\n8: A deep dive into the numbers The Sanders campaign used OpenSecrets data it obtained in December 2019.\n9: But the OpenSecrets website has since been updated with fourth-quarter filings, so we couldn\u2019t confirm the figures the campaign cited.\n10: Instead, Doug Weber, a senior CRP researcher, pointed to the 2020 presidential race section of OpenSecrets, saying it contains the most accurate data for presidential campaign contributions.\n11: It also highlights industry contribution trends focused only on the presidential giving \u2015 in other words, excluding contributions made to Senate campaign accounts.\n12: We asked Weber if Sanders\u2019 talking point about Buttigieg is true.\n13: That \"depends on what you mean by \u2018health care industry,\u2019\" Weber wrote in an email.\n14: OpenSecrets defines its health sector by contributions from PACs and individuals working in various health industries, he said, and \"for our data, that's our broadest definition of health care.\"\n15: Based on this sweeping categorization , Sanders is ahead of Buttigieg in health sector donations.\n16: The Vermont senator received $2,910,894, while the former South Bend mayor trailed closely behind with $2,713,038.\n17: However, when you break down this data by industries within the health sector, Buttigieg comes out ahead of Sanders in contributions from pharmaceutical companies and also for health services/HMOs \u2015 which includes groups like large insurance companies.\n18: But even this point is nuanced.\n19: Former Vice President Joe Biden has received the most money of any Democratic candidate from the pharmaceuticals and health products sector if contributions from his leadership political action committee are included.\n20: Leadership PACs are committees unaffiliated with campaigns that can still receive contributions and financially support candidates.\n21: In the health care industry categories of hospitals/nursing homes and health professionals , Sanders has received the most in dollar contributions.\n22: When asked to clarify how the Sanders campaign is defining the health care industry, a staffer responded that \"Bernie Sanders issued a pledge to not accept money from top officials of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries (as distinct from rank-and-file workers in those industries, which the aggregate data you cite deals with).\n23: He asked other candidates to do the same.\n24: Pete Buttigieg has refused to take that pledge, and has instead raised money from those top officials...These clear, demonstrable and verifiable facts makes very clear precisely what we are referring to.\"\n25: The Sanders campaign sent us a list of pharmaceutical and health insurance executives that have contributed to Buttigieg, including employees and executives from AbbVie, Aetna, Anthem, Eli Lilly and Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer.\n26: We checked that list against the Federal Election Commission database to ensure its accuracy.\n27: In addition, the Sanders\u2019 campaign shared an October 2019 article from Sludge, an investigative journalism outlet focused on money in politics, which estimated Buttigieg\u2019s third-quarter health care industry donations approached $97,000.\n28: We also checked in with the Buttigieg campaign for a response, which replied that \"more than 800,000 Americans\" have donated to its candidate.\n29: The campaign\u2019s emailed statement noted that Buttigieg\u2019s \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" plan draws industry attacks because the health system \"will have to provide more affordable coverage and better care or they will lose customers as people enroll in the public option.\"\n30: What does it all mean?\n31: It seems the Sanders\u2019 claim is \"imprecise,\" said Robert Maguire, research director at the nonprofit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) .\n32: \"Given that the health industry itself is vast, what I assume the Sanders\u2019 campaign \u2026 meant to say was that the more corporate aspects of the health industry \u2015 like the pharmaceutical industry and the health insurance industry \u2015 were funding Buttigieg disproportionately to others,\" he added.\n33: Michael Beckel, research director of Issue One , a nonprofit organization focused on transparency and enforcement of campaign finance laws, said the key to understanding this claim is that the Sanders campaign is characterizing money from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry differently than campaign contributions from individuals, such as nurses and other health professionals.\n34: \"Rank-and-file employees in one industry don't always express the same political preferences as executives in that industry,\" Beckel wrote in an email.\n35: \"Even as he's railed against the pharmaceutical industry and insurance industry, Sen. Sanders has welcomed support from labor unions representing nurses.\"\n36: Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany-State University of New York, also took issue with the idea that an individual giving the maximum amount of money to a campaign could sway the candidate\u2019s policies.\n37: \"Every time election season rolls around, there are stories about individuals employed in one industry favoring one candidate over another, and it could be for whatever reason,\" said Malbin.\n38: \"But, you cannot make the inference from industry coding \u2026 that they are giving just for a certain economic interest.\n39: Let alone that it\u2019s remotely enough money to drive a presidential campaign.\n40: \u2026 It\u2019s a $2,800 maximum, for crying out loud.\"\n41: The actual composition of donors in the health category can\u2019t be known without analyzing OpenSecrets\u2019 full data set \u2015 which we could not do since it\u2019s not publicly available.\n42: OpenSecrets does, however, analyze the percentage of small donor donations (less than $200) and large contributions for each presidential candidate.\n43: And 56% of Sanders\u2019 contributions are from small donors, while 45% of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign contributions come from that same group.",

        "claim": "\u201cMayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crisis in 2008.\u201d",
        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., used the Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas to launch attacks against Mike Bloomberg, including his the billionaire\u2019s rhetoric on the collapse of the housing market and financial crisis.\n1: \"When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families,\" Warren said .\n2: Warren was referring to a statement Bloomberg made in 2008 in which he said that the end of redlining \u2014 a discriminatory practice in which banks refused certain applicants, often African Americans, loans to live in certain neighborhoods \u2014 contributed to the collapse of the housing market.\n3: But Bloomberg did not blame African Americans, Latinos or any minority group.\n4: What Bloomberg said about the causes of the financial crisis The Warren campaign pointed to what Bloomberg said at a forum in September 2008 at Georgetown University .\n5: At various points in the hourlong interview , Bloomberg spoke broadly about loose lending as a factor in the financial crisis.\n6: Bloomberg identified pressure by Congress to expand lending after the ban on redlining as one of those causes.\n7: The term \"redlining\" comes from when bankers would draw lines on maps indicating poorer neighborhoods where they would avoid offering mortgages.\n8: Those areas often include large minority populations.\n9: Bloomberg did not talk about the racial aspects of redlining or bring up any minority groups.\n10: Instead, he seemed to define redlining narrowly as excluding loan applicants in poor neighborhoods.\n11: And he described a system in which, by enacting a ban on redlining, Congress encouraged banks to give mortgages to people whether or not they could afford them.\n12: Here\u2019s what Bloomberg said: \"It all started back when there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone.\n13: Redlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, \u2018People in these neighborhoods are poor, they\u2019re not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don\u2019t go into those areas.\u2019\" He continued: \"And then Congress got involved \u2014 local elected officials, as well \u2014 and said, \u2018Oh that\u2019s not fair, these people should be able to get credit.\u2019 And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn\u2019t as good as you would like.\"\n14: Warren\u2019s argument is essentially that by citing the pushback against redlining as factor in the crisis, Bloomberg was blaming African Americans and Latinos.\n15: Bloomberg\u2019s description of redlining may have sounded naive in that he didn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge the discriminatory impact against racial minorities.\n16: But that\u2019s a long way from blaming African Americans or Latinos for the housing collapse.\n17: In the same interview, Bloomberg cited several other factors that led to the crisis, but he made no mention at all of minorities.\n18: Bloomberg talked about how the mortgage crisis accelerated after mortgages were approved too easily for borrowers who didn\u2019t have the means to repay them.\n19: \"There was pressure to open up the spigot and to sell mortgages to everyone,\" he said.\n20: Bloomberg\u2019s eight-minute answer also lobbed criticism at financial companies, saying that they didn\u2019t understand the risks and volatility of their own products.\n21: He said that Bear Stearns, AIG and Lehman Brothers all had reputations for being very aggressive.\n22: \"They got themselves so far out there that when the mortgage market collapsed, they couldn\u2019t value the things that they owned,\" he said.\n23: \"They didn\u2019t know how many mortgages at the very bottom were going to be good.\"\n24: In 2011, Bloomberg repeated his opinion that Congress was to blame for the crisis, because it \"pushed the banks to loan to everybody .\"\n25: In this statement, he appeared to let bankers off the hook.\n26: \"It was not the banks that created the mortgage crisis,\" he said.\n27: \"It was, plain and simple, Congress who forced everybody to go and to give mortgages to people who were on the cusp.\n28: Now I\u2019m not so sure that was terrible policy because a lot of those people who got homes still have them, and they wouldn\u2019t have had them without that.\"\n29: RELATED: What caused crisis?\n30: No one thing Many experts have pushed back against the idea that eliminating redlining was a culprit for the financial meltdown.\n31: The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the 1977 law against redlining was \"not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis.\"\n32: When we contacted the Bloomberg campaign, the campaign pointed to other statements Bloomberg made in which he mentioned various factors.\n33: Speaking in London in October 2008 , Bloomberg said that automated trading contributed to the market\u2019s volatility.\n34: He said that the United States had an \"antiquated patchwork of regulatory bodies\" that lacked transparency.\n35: At that event, Bloomberg was asked to respond to a magazine article suggesting the origins of the subprime mortgage crisis could be traced to the Clinton administration\u2019s anti-discrimination drive that cajoled banks to lend to people who were not creditworthy.\n36: Bloomberg said : \"I think it might have contributed a little bit, but what happened was fundamentally everybody was doing well.\n37: And when everybody\u2019s doing well, we let our guard down, we take risks that we would not otherwise have taken, and what happened plain and simple is that the modeling said these mortgages were going to be paid off.\"",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: One Assembly Republican making the case for a series of tough-on-crime bills says a statewide rise in violent crime shows why the bills are needed.\n1: The bills would return more people to prison for probation violations, put more juveniles behind bars and limit early release for inmates.\n2: They illuminate a key ideological divide between Republicans seeking more time behind bars for certain offenders and a Democratic governor who has called for cutting the state's prison population in half in the coming years.\n3: In the GOP Weekly Radio Address on Feb. 13, 2020, state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo , R-New Berlin, used a series of numbers to support bills he said would \"help keep Wisconsin communities safe.\"\n4: \"FBI data shows violent crime rates increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017,\" said Sanfelippo.\n5: \"In fact, when combining Wisconsin\u2019s 10 largest cities, the violent crime rate increased by 24% during that time, while decreasing by 14% on a national average.\"\n6: It\u2019s certainly an eye-catching claim.\n7: Is violent crime up in all but two of the hundreds of cities across Wisconsin?\n8: We checked it out \u2014 and found a case study in how not to use data.\n9: Sanfelippo misquoted the stat he was trying to use while constructing an argument riddled with other data-related problems.\n10: Let\u2019s see what the data actually tells us.\n11: Newer data available Asked for evidence supporting his discussion of violent crime, Sanfelippo\u2019s office pointed us to a policy brief the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum published in December 2019.\n12: Amid a discussion of police spending and staffing, the paper used FBI data to say violent crime had risen in Wisconsin from 2008 to 2017.\n13: The FBI gathers crime stats from departments around the country, and reports a \"violent crime\" tally based on the number of homicides, sexual assaults, robberies and aggravated assaults.\n14: (We should point out the Wisconsin Department of Justice also gathers crime data that in some cases varies slightly from the FBI, but we\u2019ll limit our analysis here to the FBI data since that is what is cited by both Sanfelippo and the report he relied on.)\n15: Sanfelippo and the paper point to 2017 data.\n16: But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,\u00a0 shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases.\n17: The number of violent crimes Wisconsin law enforcement reported to the FBI fell from 15,931 in 2017 to 15,263 in 2018.\n18: But that\u2019s not necessarily a reliable number.\n19: Here\u2019s why.\n20: Not all data comparable The FBI crime data is difficult to compare year-to-year because it\u2019s not comprehensive.\n21: Not every police department reports their data every year.\n22: And state and local officials regularly change their reporting practices, changing definitions or other factors in generating counts.\n23: To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now \"not comparable to previous years\u2019 data.\"\n24: This was not taken into account in Sanfelippo\u2019s claim or the memo his office cited as backup.\n25: In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years.\n26: That included three of the 10 largest cities \u2014 which you\u2019ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime.\n27: We\u2019ll also note that while Sanfelippo referred to cities, the FBI data includes cities, towns and villages, so we\u2019ll refer to the group as municipalities here.\n28: Key outlier ignored Sanfelippo \u2014 like many other Republicans \u2014 is using the FBI data to say violent crime is on the rise across Wisconsin.\n29: But that's not really what the data shows.\n30: More than two-thirds of the violent crimes in Wisconsin take place in Milwaukee, so in large part the statewide trend is just a reflection of what\u2019s happening in the state\u2019s largest city.\n31: Violent crime in Milwaukee has edged up and down in recent years, but 2018 was the city\u2019s lowest mark since 2013.\n32: Addressing these three data issues (age, comparability and the Milwaukee outlier) lets us bring the state\u2019s actual violent crime trend into clearer focus.\n33: And we find there essentially is no trend.\n34: Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities \u2014 still a solid sample size.\n35: Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018.\n36: But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change.\n37: Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 \u2014 virtually unchanged.\n38: Claim drastically overstated But all of these data mistakes pale in comparison to Sanfelippo\u2019s dramatic misuse of the memo\u2019s description.\n39: The memo said \u2014 again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing \u2014 that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state\u2019s 10 largest cities.\n40: Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in \"all but two Wisconsin cities.\"\n41: That\u2019s not even close to true.\n42: Using the 206 municipalities referenced above \u2014 those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven\u2019t changed reporting practices \u2014 we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20.\n43: Sanfelippo acknowledged using the stat incorrectly when questioned by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n44: The reference, which was wrong in both the recorded and written versions of the radio address, came from a script that Sanfelippo said wasn\u2019t written by him or his office.\n45: \"It wasn\u2019t intentionally done, it was just a mistake,\" he said.\n46: \"I should have picked up on that for as much as I have been talking about crime these last few months.\"",

Medicaid enrollees also have more difficulty finding a specialist physician who will treat them.\"\n11: We opted to look at those issues separately.\n12: What about health status?\n13: Several national Medicaid experts said Verma is wrong to use health status as a proxy for whether Medicaid helps improve health for people.\n14: That\u2019s because to be eligible for Medicaid, people must fall into a low-income bracket, which can impact their health in many ways.\n15: For example, they may live in substandard housing or not get proper nutrition and exercise.\n16: In addition, lack of transportation or child care responsibilities can hamper their ability to visit doctors.\n17: Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University, said Verma\u2019s comparison of the health status of Medicaid recipients against people with Medicare or private insurance is invalid because the populations are so different and face varied health risks.\n18: \"This wouldn\u2019t pass muster in a first-year statistics class,\" he said.\n19: Death rates, for example, are higher among people in the Medicare program than those in private insurance or Medicaid, he said, but that\u2019s not a knock on Medicare.\n20: It\u2019s because Medicare primarily covers people 65 and older.\n21: By definition, Medicaid covers the most vulnerable people in the community, from newborns to the disabled and the poor, said Rachel Nuzum, a vice president with the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund.\n22: \"The Medicaid population does not look like the privately insured population.\"\n23: Joe Antos, a health economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, also agreed, saying he is leery of any studies or statements that evaluate Medicaid without adjusting for risk.\n24: For a better mechanism to gauge health outcomes under Medicaid, experts point to dozens of studies that track what happened in states that chose in the past six years to pursue the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n25: The health law gave states the option to extend Medicaid to everyone with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $17,600 annually for an individual.\n26: Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.\n27: \"Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population,\" concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation in summarizing findings from more than 300 studies.\n28: \"Studies show improved self-reported health following expansion and an association between expansion and certain positive health outcomes.\"\n29: (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n30: Studies found the expansion of Medicaid led to lower mortality rates for people with heart disease and among end-stage renal disease patients initiating dialysis .\n31: Researchers also reported that Medicaid expansion was associated with declines in the length of stay of hospitalized patients.\n32: One study found a link between expansion and declines in mechanical ventilation rates among patients hospitalized for various conditions.\n33: Another recent study compared the health characteristics of low-income residents of Texas, which has not expanded Medicaid, and those of Arkansas and Kentucky, which did.\n34: It found that new Medicaid enrollees in the latter two states were 41 percentage points more likely to have a usual source of care and 23 percentage points more likely to say they were in excellent health than a comparable group of Texas residents.\n35: Medicaid\u2019s benefits, though, affect far more than the millions of nondisabled adults who gained coverage as a result of the ACA.\n36: \"Medicaid coverage was associated with a range of positive health behaviors and outcomes, including increased access to care; improved self-reported health status; higher rates of preventive health screenings; lower likelihood of delaying care because of costs; decreased hospital and emergency department utilization; and decreased infant, child, and adult mortality rates,\" according to a report issued this month by the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n37: Children \u2014 who make up nearly half of Medicaid enrollees \u2014 have also benefited from the coverage, studies find.\n38: Some studies report that Medicaid contributes to improved health outcomes, including reductions in avoidable hospitalizations and lower child mortality.\n39: Research shows people on Medicaid are generally happy with the coverage.\n40: A Commonwealth Fund survey found 90% of adults with Medicaid were satisfied or very satisfied with their coverage, a slightly higher percentage than those with employer coverage.\n41: Accessible care?\n42: The evidence here is less emphatic.\n43: A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found 84% of Medicaid recipients felt they were able to get all the medical care they needed in the previous six months.\n44: Only 3% said they could not get care because of long wait times or because doctors would not accept their insurance.\n45: Verma cites a 2017 MACPAC report that noted some people on Medicaid have issues accessing care.\n46: But that report also noted: \"The body of work to date by MACPAC and others shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have much better access to care, and much higher health care utilization, than individuals without insurance, particularly when controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and health status.\"\n47: It also notes that \"Medicaid beneficiaries also fare as well as or better than individuals with private insurance on some access measures.\"\n48: The report said people with Medicaid are as likely as those with private insurance to have a usual source of care, a doctor visit each year and certain services such as a Pap test to detect cervical cancer.\n49: \"Medicaid is not great coverage, but it does open the door for health access to help people deal with medical problems before they become acute,\" Antos said.\n50: On the negative side, the report said Medicaid recipients are more likely than privately insured patients to experience longer waiting times to see a doctor.\n51: They also are less likely to receive mammograms, colorectal tests and dental visits than the privately insured.\n52: \"Compared to having no insurance at all, having Medicaid improves access to care and improves health,\" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n53: \"There is pretty strong evidence that Medicaid helps patients get the care they need.\"",

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: On the heels of a fiesty Democratic debate that touched on everything from health care to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s past comments and positions, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joined MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" to talk about an issue that didn\u2019t come up: Guns.\n1: Klobuchar said she was \"sad\" that gun violence wasn\u2019t talked about during the debate in Las Vegas, the location of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history in 2017.\n2: She also lamented the lack of progress in Congress on universal background checks.\n3: \"The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters,\" Klobuchar said.\n4: \"There\u2019s absolutely no reason we shouldn\u2019t be moving on it.\"\n5: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We\u2019ve fact-checked a number of related claims from Democrats about support for universal background checks among groups such as NRA members , gun owners and Republicans .\n6: But what about hunters?\n7: And what about supporters of President Donald Trump?\n8: Klobuchar has made the same claim a few times before, including on ABC\u2019s \"The View,\" so we decided to check it out.\n9: We found that her statement lines up with the available polls.\n10: RELATED: Do gun background checks work?\n11: What the research shows Recap: What are universal background checks?\n12: Many Democrats have called for universal background checks, which would require background checks on nearly all gun purchases, including private sales made at events such as gun shows.\n13: The Democrat-led House passed a bill in 2019 to ban the private transfer of firearms unless a licensed gun dealer or manufacturer takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.\n14: But the GOP-led Senate has refused to take it up .\n15: Trump, meanwhile, has made inconsistent statements about background checks, often touting the need to strengthen them in the wake of mass shootings only to walk back his support later.\n16: Limited polling shows support among Trump voters, hunters When we examined a previous claim about GOP support for universal background checks, we found a number of polls that showed Republican approval floating between 82% and 95%.\n17: Not all registered Republicans necessarily voted or are planning to vote for Trump, whose approval rating within the party has generally held within the mid-to-high 80s.\n18: But a few polls that have narrowed the scope to Trump voters lend credence to Klobuchar\u2019s claim.\n19: The Klobuchar campaign specifically cited an Aug. 14 Fox News poll that asked 1,013 randomly sampled registered voters if they \"favor or oppose\" proposals \"requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales.\"\n20: That poll \u2014 conducted shortly after mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas \u2014 found support for such proposals from 90% of \"Trump voters,\" with 8% signaling opposition and 2% saying they didn\u2019t know.\n21: Similarly, a mid July Marist poll conducted in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour asked 1,346 respondents about \"background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales.\"\n22: And 82% of \"2016 Trump supporters\" said the checks were a \"good idea.\"\n23: Still, it\u2019s worth noting that support for background checks doesn\u2019t always line up with voting for specific pieces of legislation.\n24: The National Rifle Association has pointed to 2016 referendums in Maine and Nevada that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls .\n25: It\u2019s also not clear how many people surveyed as part of the Fox News and Marist polls identified as Trump voters or supporters, although the Marist poll only reported results for subgroups of at least 100 people.\n26: Small sample sizes could be misleading, even if a larger number of polls shows high support for background checks among Republicans more generally.\n27: But Klobuchar claimed only that a majority of Trump voters want background checks, leaving her wiggle room to account for margins of error or changes in public opinion over time.\n28: We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions.\n29: Support our mission today.\n30: Membership.politifact.com As for hunters, the Klobuchar campaign cited a 2013 Politico article about a poll commissioned by Bull Moose Sportsmen\u2019s Alliance , an advocacy group representing hunters and sportsmen.\n31: That poll surveyed 800 hunters and found that 77% support \"requiring anyone who wants to purchase a firearm to pass a criminal background check before each potential gun purchase.\"\n32: It also found that 72% of hunters support criminal background checks that allow for exemptions for \"gun exchanges between family members, sharing guns on hunting trips and shooting ranges, or sales to those who have concealed carry permits from state government.\"\n33: By now, the poll is almost seven years old.\n34: Liam Sullivan, press secretary for Brady United Against Gun Violence, a gun control advocacy group, said the organization was not aware of any other surveys measuring hunters\u2019 support for background checks.\n35: We couldn\u2019t find other related polls via Google and Nexis.\n36: Neither could Everytown for Gun Safety, another gun control advocacy organization.\n37: But Sullivan noted that pollsters\u2006\u2014 including the Pew Research Center \u2014 have found majority support for background checks among gun owners more generally.",

        "passage": "0: At a rally in Houston, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg apologized for supporting the stop-and-frisk policy he endorsed while serving as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013.\n1: Bloomberg told the mostly black audience at the rally that he should have \"acted sooner and faster\" to stop the policy and said if he were elected, he\u2019d use \"the power of the presidency to right the wrongs of institutional racism.\"\n2: He used the rally as an opportunity to unveil a new initiative that he says will address issues specific to the black community in the United States: \"Mike for Black America.\"\n3: One issue he highlighted in his address was access to health care.\n4: \"We will build a future in which we better protect the health of black mothers and their babies,\" Bloomberg said at the rally.\n5: \"You should know that black babies die at rates twice as high as white babies because of a lack of access to affordable health care and here, in the wealthiest country in the world, we cannot accept that and we will change that.\"\n6: Bloomberg\u2019s figure is accurate, but is he right in his assessment of the cause of this disparity?\n7: His team did not return a request for more information about his claim.\n8: Mortality rate higher for black infants The latest statistics on infant mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that there were 22,341 infant deaths reported in the United States in 2017, putting the mortality rate at 5.79 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.\n9: Statistics on infant mortality are compiled based on birth and infant death certificates in cases where infants less than a year died during the calendar year.\n10: Generally, the infant mortality rate has trended downward since 1995 and has declined 16% since 2005, when the rate was 6.86 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n11: The CDC also analyzes the infant mortality rate by race.\n12: In 2017, infants born to black women had the highest mortality rate of 10.97 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n13: The mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers was 4.67 deaths per 1,000 live births, meaning infants born to black mothers have an infant mortality rate 2.35 times higher than infants born to white mothers, according to the CDC.\n14: Bloomberg\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t limited to Texas, but this trend is also visible at the state level.\n15: A 2018 report from the CDC looked at infant mortality data from 2013 to 2015 by state and race and found that, in Texas, the mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white women was 5 deaths per 1,000 live births and was 10.52 for infants born to black women.\n16: Exploring causes of disparity It\u2019s true that infants born to black mothers have died at rates twice as high as white babies in recent years, but is it true that it is due to a lack of access to affordable health care?\n17: It isn\u2019t that simple.\n18: The five leading causes of all infant deaths in 2017 identified by the CDC were all health related: Congenital malformations: 21% of infant deaths Disorders related to short gestation and low birthweight: 17% of infant deaths Maternal complications: 6% of infant deaths Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): 6% of infant deaths Unintentional injuries: 6% of infant deaths In a 2019 report, the CDC noted that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rates for disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight and maternal complications.\n19: Numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers.\n20: But access to health care is widely considered to be one of many contributing factors.\n21: One 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health identified other factors that contribute to the high black infant mortality rate: socioeconomic status, maternal behavior, \"exposure to protective and risk factors over the course of a woman\u2019s life,\" and certain historical factors like segregation, limited educational opportunities, structural racism, and intergenerational poverty.\n22: This is not to say that a lack of access to health care is not a significant cause of this disparity.\n23: A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2019 explored how state Medicaid expansion associated with changes in low birthweight and preterm birth across different races \u2014 which are more likely to affect black mothers and infants than white mothers and infants.\n24: The study did not explore the link between Medicaid expansion and reducing infant mortality.\n25: Researchers found that overall, Medicaid expansion was not associated with differences in rates of low birth weight or preterm births.\n26: However, they identified \"significant improvements in relative disparities for black infants compared with white infants in states that expanded Medicaid vs. those that did not.\"\n27: In other words, states that expanded Medicaid saw rates of low birthweight and preterm births decline among black mothers and infants.\n28: In general, black mothers were less likely than white mothers to access prenatal care, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Office of Minority Health.\n29: In 2017, black mothers were 2.3 times more likely to receive no prenatal care or late prenatal care than non-Hispanic white mothers.\n30: The same year, 66.6% of black mothers received prenatal care during the first trimester, compared to 82.4% of white mothers who accessed early care.",

Donna Shalala , D-Fla., said, \"I'm hoping that in the future, Sen.

Austin State University looked at whether the Cubans set the literacy bar too low, and found that they used a reasonable benchmark.\n28: \"We did see evidence of basic literacy development, typical of what we might like to see in first graders here in America,\" Abel said.\n29: Today, the World Bank puts the adult literacy rate in Cuba at 99.8%, about 8 points higher than the average for the Caribbean region.\n30: Sanders\u2019 comments about Cuba mirror those of President Barack Obama in 2016 , soon after he had moved to open diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n31: Obama spoke to a group of up-and-coming leaders of the Americas, and said their generation had the chance to get beyond old political labels and explore practical solutions.\n32: \"I said (to Castro), look, you've made great progress in educating young people.\n33: Every child in Cuba gets a basic education \u2014 that's a huge improvement from where it was.\"\n34: But Obama continued on to describe the benefits of private enterprise and the failures of the Cuban economy.\n35: Above all, he urged his audience to be \"practical.\"",

Democrats.\n5: And several of them score majority support among all voters.\n6: However, support among all voters for some of Sanders\u2019 proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs.\n7: And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options \u2014 some of them backed by Sanders\u2019 competitors \u2014 receive wider support from voters than his proposals do.\n8: Would

single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave.\n11: We found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as \"reordering\" the economy.\n12: By shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for 17.7% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product .\n13: This policy, and breaking up big banks, \"would

economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels.\n16: The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee.\n17: Economists\u2019 views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector \u2014 making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt \u2014 could have a significant impact on the economy.\n18: And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders\u2019 plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors.\n19: \"It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,\" said Daniel Mitchell, a pro-free market economist .\n20: How popular are Sanders\u2019 proposals?\n21: We collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below.\n22: The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.\n23: The data shows that \u2014 contrary to what Buttigieg said \u2014 a large share of Democrats support Sanders\u2019 economic proposals, according to polls.\n24: Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.\n25: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Among all Americans, only one of these policies \u2014 single-payer health care \u2014 gets less than 50% support.\n26: Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters.\n27: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Warning signs That said, other poll results give Buttigieg\u2019s remark some support.\n28: First, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance.\n29: As it turns out, Buttigieg\u2019s own policy preference \u2014 a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it \u2014 wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system.\n30: In February 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both.\n31: Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer.\n32: Second, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option \u2014 often including the cost required \u2014 usually reduced the levels of support.\n33: Here are some examples: \u2022 $15 minimum wage .\n34: A SurveyMonkey poll conducted for Business Insider asked two questions about the $15 minimum wage.\n35: The first was, \"Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?\"\n36: This question elicited 63% support among all respondents.\n37: The second question added that the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress \u2014 found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs.\n38: Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%.\n39: \u2022 Student loan forgiveness .\n40: A Quinnipiac University poll in April 2019 asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness.\n41: First, the pollsters asked, \"Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?\"\n42: This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats.\n43: Then they asked, \"Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?\"\n44: On this question, Democratic support remained strong \u2014 72% \u2014 but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition.\n45: \u2022 Paid family leave .\n46: A survey sponsored by the libertarian Cato Institute showed strong initial support \u2014 74% among all respondents \u2014 for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need.\n47: But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned.\n48: The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes.\n49: \u2022 Green New Deal .\n50: A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs.\n51: These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%).\n52: The one unpopular aspect of the plan?\n53: Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents.",

        "label": "half-true",
        "passage": "0: As the Democratic presidential campaign moves to the battleground of South Carolina this weekend, candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is highlighting his health plan as he seeks to slow the momentum of the front-runner, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n1: In a video ad airing across the state, Buttigieg argues that his health plan \u2014 called \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" \u2014 offers Americans their choice of insurance plans, in a way he says Sanders\u2019 more sweeping \"Medicare for All\" plan does not.\n2: The Sanders plan would eliminate private insurance and move everyone into a government-run program.\n3: Under Buttigieg\u2019s proposal, the ad says, \"Everyone gets access to Medicare, if they choose.\"\n4: Specifically, according to campaign documents, people or employers could buy into a government-provided health plan, which the campaign says would provide an \"affordable, comprehensive alternative\" to what is sold on the private market.\n5: But, the voiceover adds, \"if you like your private plan, you can keep it.\"\n6: This isn\u2019t the first time a politician has made such a promise.\n7: Arguing in favor of the Affordable Care Act, then-President Barack Obama repeatedly said the health law would let people keep their private health plans, if they liked them.\n8: That didn\u2019t pan out: Millions of Americans\u2019 plans were canceled, spawning months of controversy.\n9: In 2013, PolitiFact rated Obama\u2019s statement the \"Lie of the Year.\"\n10: With that context, we decided to look deeper at Buttigieg\u2019s remark.\n11: We reached out to his campaign but never heard back.\n12: An uncertain market Experts we talked to said the former mayor\u2019s remark is remarkably similar to Obama\u2019s \u2015 right down to the pitfalls it encounters.\n13: Those policy analysts said Buttigieg is trying to differentiate his plan from Sanders\u2019 sweeping proposal, arguing his offering is more moderate than Sanders\u2019 and preserves choice.\n14: He suggests many Americans would be able to pick between buying private insurance or opting into the government plan.\n15: But does that mean that if you like your plan, you can keep it?\n16: As the Obama White House learned, not necessarily.\n17: \"It\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n18: The problem is that private insurance availability isn\u2019t up to the government.\n19: To be sure, state and federal regulators have the power to dictate, for example, the inclusion of certain benefits and to set basic consumer protections.\n20: But the government cannot specifically require insurance companies to offer plans, and any carrier has the option to stop providing coverage.\n21: Already, market forces dictate what health insurance is available from year to year.\n22: For example, negotiations between an insurer and physicians could mean that an insurer drops doctors from its network.\n23: Changing profit margins could drive a private carrier to exit a certain market.\n24: An employer looking to trim expenses might decide to change health insurers, changing coverage offerings for employees.\n25: Buttigieg\u2019s health plan \u2014 which would more generously subsidize people buying private insurance than the ACA does and create a public health insurance option that individuals and employers could buy \u2015 wouldn\u2019t change any of those economic scenarios.\n26: \"When you have private plans offered and sold by private companies, those private companies are going to make business decisions that might affect your coverage,\" Corlette said.\n27: \"They can opt to get out of the business.\"\n28: That\u2019s been especially clear in the ACA individual marketplace.\n29: In many counties, only one private insurer sells coverage on the marketplace.\n30: It\u2019s impossible to predict, but a competing public option might change the financial incentives for those plans and push some of those carriers to abandon the exchange.\n31: If that happened, people using that plan would lose the insurance they have, regardless of how they feel about it.\n32: Put more forcefully, \"There\u2019s no way the government can guarantee a private plan will continue, without mandating it will,\" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n33: So, she added, suggesting that people who like their private plans will have the option to keep them under Buttigieg\u2019s proposal is \"probably not true.\"\n34: (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n35: The employer question This is especially the case when it comes to the nearly 160 million people who get their insurance from an employer.\n36: Already, that group experiences volatility when it comes to their health insurance.\n37: In 2019, 53% of employers providing coverage considered changing the plan or the carrier they offered, according to a KFF survey .\n38: Of that group, almost a fifth \u2014 18% \u2015 ultimately did change insurance carriers.\n39: That flux would likely increase under a plan like Buttigieg\u2019s.\n40: Already, many employers (particularly smaller ones) indicate frustration with providing a health benefit that is increasingly complex and expensive.\n41: If a public option were cheaper, more might shift employees into that pool, dropping private insurance.\n42: \"Even if you don\u2019t want the public option, your employer might decide that they do,\" Cox said.\n43: How big the change would be is difficult to gauge.\n44: It depends, for instance, on how generous the public option is, how much it costs employers and whether current private insurance trends continue.\n45: Still, \"any change you make to the health care environment would cause changes to reverberate throughout the system,\" said Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean of New York University\u2019s Wagner School of Public Service.\n46: \"Any government action will cause change to happen more than they would otherwise.\"\n47: It\u2019s worth noting that many people may not be affected.\n48: Under the ACA, for instance, 4 million lost their plans, or fewer than 2% of all people who had coverage.\n49: Most people who move from private insurance to the public option would likely have better benefits, said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at the Harvard T.H.\n50: Chan School of Public Health.\n51: But, some would be unhappy to lose the existing, private coverage that they know.\n52: \"The more accurate soundbite would be most people with private insurance would be able to keep it,\" he added.\n53: \"That would beg the question of who isn\u2019t included there \u2014 and the answer is, we don\u2019t know.\"\n54: And, in contrast with Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All single-payer proposal, Buttigieg\u2019s plan would preserve much of the current private

Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, who co-sponsored a bill in 2019 to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024.\n2: The bill passed in the House in July 2019 and is stalled in the Senate, but Pocan is still talking about wage growth \u2014 most recently in his endorsement of Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n3: In a Jan. 16, 2020 video with Sanders posted on Twitter, Pocan described an advertisement he saw for the Amazon distribution center in his hometown of Kenosha, seeking workers for $12.75 an hour.\n4: \"Your parents made that three decades ago, and that\u2019s what people are making now,\" Pocan said to the camera.\n5: Is Pocan right on the numbers?\n6: And what about his underlying point: that real wages haven\u2019t changed much in 30 years?\n7: We checked it out.\n8: Crunching the numbers When asked for evidence to back up Pocan\u2019s claim, communications director Usamah Andrabi provided historical pay data for the nation\u2019s auto industry and the median income for Wisconsin men and women according to the 1990 census.\n9: Andrabi said Pocan often uses auto worker pay to make his point, because auto manufacturing was the dominant industry in Kenosha when he was growing up there.\n10: But Pocan did not mention auto pay in his claim, and pay in that industry historically is far higher than many other jobs.\n11: So, we focused on the weekly and hourly earnings data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n12: Let\u2019s walk through the math.\n13: Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, said the best metric to use in examining the claim is median wages \u2014 and, of course, to examine them in \"real\" terms, to compare the spending power over time.\n14: The median wage for Americans in December 1990 was $417 per week, which breaks down to $10.43 an hour.\n15: Fast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour.\n16: That might look like a significant increase.\n17: But using the Bureau\u2019s inflation calculator, the 1990 weekly wage translates to $800.88 per week in today\u2019s dollars, or $20.02 an hour.\n18: So, that\u2019s a roughly $3 increase in 30 years.\n19: From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off \u2014 an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in.\n20: He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant.\n21: An August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country\u2019s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners.\n22: For those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat.\n23: What\u2019s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices.\n24: So, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods.",

        "passage": "0: During his campaign for president, Michael Bloomberg has pointed to his record as a three-term mayor of New York City, highlighting\u00a0certain parts to appeal to Democratic primary voters.\n1: On his campaign website, Bloomberg claims that during his tenure, \"street homelessness decreased by 28 percent.\"\n2: \"As Mayor of New York City, Mike led one of the nation\u2019s most ambitious affordable housing plans, implementing several initiatives that have been replicated in cities around the country.\n3: During his tenure, street homelessness decreased by 28% and more than 170,000 affordable homes were built or preserved,\" his site states .\n4: We were curious about Bloomberg\u2019s claim about \"street homelessness,\" and reached out to the campaign.\n5: Spokesman Michael Frazier directed us to a city report from 2013.\n6: According to the Mayor\u2019s Management Report , \"the estimate of those living on the street in 2013 is 28 percent lower than the baseline established in 2005.\"\n7: Street homelessness is a portion of the total number of people who are homeless.\n8: The city considers people who sleep on the streets or in the\u00a0parks\u00a0or subway system to be part of this subset.\n9: It does not include the much larger number of people in the city\u2019s shelters.\n10: The Bloomberg administration began counting people who are part of the\u00a0street homeless population in 2005.\n11: Data from the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services show a 28 percent drop in the number of people who slept on the streets or in the parks and subway during annual point-in-time counts between 2005 and 2013.\n12: On March 7, 2005, volunteers counted 4,395 street homeless people for the inaugural Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, or HOPE count.\n13: On Jan. 28, 2013, the last year of Bloomberg's tenure, the count was\u00a03,180.\n14: The count on Jan. 27, 2014, a month after Bloomberg left office, was 3,357, or a drop of 24 percent from 2005.\n15: Mixed reviews The Urban Institute published a report in 2014, funded by the Bloomberg administration, supporting\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s claim.\n16: Under Bloomberg, New York City became a \"national model for how to reduce unsheltered and chronic homelessness,\" wrote Josh Leopold, a senior research associate.\n17: In an interview, Leopold said the administration did not interfere with his work on the report.\n18: Bloomberg\u2019s management background contributed to the city\u2019s efforts to organize street outreach and coordinate services for homeless people, he said.\n19: \"His administration should get a lot of credit for that,\" Leopold said.\n20: While the counting methodology does account for including some people the counters may have missed, the data can be unreliable, according to some experts.\n21: In a paper published by the\u00a0conservative American Enterprise Institute, Kevin C. Corinth wrote that \"street counts are inherently difficult to conduct and should therefore be treated cautiously.\"\n22: Giselle Routhier, policy director for Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy organization that has been critical of Bloomberg, said that the shelter census is a better measure.\n23: \"We never trust the HOPE estimate,\" Routhier said.\n24: The count could be influenced by various factors, such as the weather.\n25: Counters can also miss homeless people on the street because they may not always be in publicly visible places, such as an ATM vestibule, and efforts to get people off the street in the week before the annual count can affect the result, she said.\n26: New York City provides temporary emergency shelter to every eligible man, woman, and child, every night.\n27: This means that many of the city's homeless are in shelters, not on the street, Routhier said.\n28: While the street homeless population has fluctuated between 2,328 and 4,395 since 2005, according to the HOPE counts , the shelter population surpassed 50,000 under Bloomberg .\n29: Other homelessness experts gave Bloomberg mixed report cards on his efforts, even as some said that his claim of reducing street homelessness is correct.\n30: Thomas J.\n31: Main, a professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, credited\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to prevent homelessness and his outreach to people living on the street.\n32: On balance, Bloomberg's record is positive, Main said.\n33: Main, however, wrote in his book, \"Homelessness in New York City: Policymaking from Koch to de Blasio,\" that a policy change that ended homeless families receiving priority in access to public housing \"would be seen as part of the reason why the shelter population was to grow to unprecedented levels.\"\n34: Main also notes homelessness is sometimes driven by factors outside of a mayor\u2019s control, such as recessions and state and federal policy.\n35: City University of New York Professor John Krinsky called Bloomberg\u2019s claim \"both technically true and very misleading,\" given the increase in the number of people staying in homeless shelters.",

        "passage": "0: Virginia Gov.\n1: Ralph Northam worked as a doctor before he was elected to helm the Commonwealth, and it\u2019s not hard to find photos of him online wearing a stethoscope around his neck.\n2: One such picture shared on social media features text on top criticizing the state.\n3: \"Thanks Virginia,\" it says.\n4: \"OK to kill babies once born.\"\n5: This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n6: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n7: One account that posted the image also links to a Jan. 30, 2019, National Review article with this headline: \"Virginia governor defends letting infants die.\"\n8: It is not legal to kill babies once born in Virginia.\n9: That is a felony.\n10: But here\u2019s what you need to know about the late-term abortion debate in the state.\n11: That story cites a radio interview Northam did with the station WTOP , after a Jan. 29, 2019, committee hearing on proposed legislation that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions.\n12: The bill was introduced by Kathy Tran, a Democatic delegate to the state House, and during the hearing she fielded questions from Todd Gilbert, a Republican delegate.\n13: \"How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?\"\n14: Gilbert asked.\n15: \"Through the third trimester,\" Tran said.\n16: \"The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.\"\n17: \"Where it\u2019s obvious that the woman is about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?\n18: She\u2019s dilating,\" he said.\n19: \"My bill would allow that,\" Tran said.\n20: The next day, Northam appeared on the radio show.\n21: Reporter Julie Carey asked him this question: \"There was a very contentious committee hearing yesterday, when Fairfax County delegate Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as other restrictions now in place, and she was pressed by a Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even as a woman is essentially dilating, ready to give birth, and she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor.\n22: Do you support her measure?\n23: And explain her answer.\"\n24: Northam said he couldn\u2019t speak for Tran but that the situation illustrates why such decisions should be made by physicians and parents.\n25: \"When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician \u2014\u00a0more than one physician, by the way \u2014\u00a0and it\u2019s done in cases where there are severe deformities, there may be a fetus that is nonviable,\" he said.\n26: \"So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.\n27: The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,\" he said.\n28: \"So I think this was really blown out of proportion but again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.\n29: We want the decisions to be made by the mothers and the providers, and this is why legislators \u2026 most of whom are men, shouldn\u2019t be telling a woman what she should and shouldn\u2019t be doing with her body.\"\n30: Virginia law already allowed abortions after the second trimester but required three doctors to certify that the mother would die or her mental and physical health would be \"substantially and irremediably\" impaired without the procedure.\n31: Tran\u2019s bill, which died in committee, would have eliminated the requirement that two other physicians certify that a late-term abortion is necessary to prevent the mother\u2019s death or harm or mental or physical health.\n32: It also eliminated the words \"substantially and irremediably\" from the law, among other changes.\n33: In the interview, Northam said he supported keeping the state\u2019s requirement that multiple physicians certify the abortion is necessary because \"these decisions shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\"\n34: The Democratic governor\u2019s comments drew criticism from conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \"I never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide,\" he tweeted on Jan. 30.\n35: U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called Northam\u2019s comments \"morally repugnant.\"\n36: \"In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from \u2018safe, legal, and rare\u2019 to \u2018keep newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide,\u2019\" Sasse said.\n37: \"I don\u2019t care what party you\u2019re from \u2014\u00a0if you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office.\"\n38: Tran later said she misspoke when she was asked whether her bill would let an abortion happen when the mother was in labor and about to give birth.\n39: \"I should have said, \u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\u2019\" In Virginia, killing a newborn is a felony punishable by death.\n40: A Northam spokesperson told Vox that his comments were \"absolutely not\" a reference to infanticide.\n41: Rather, they \"focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\"\n42: He called the idea that he approved of killing infants \"disgusting,\" according to the Washington Post .",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: In the South Carolina presidential debate , Bernie Sanders continued to parry attacks for having said that Cuba did something good when it launched a massive literacy campaign under Fidel Castro.\n1: (We rated that claim Mostly True , noting that the teaching materials came with hefty ideological baggage.)\n2: This sort of criticism isn\u2019t new for Sanders.\n3: Thanks to his past comments on Marxist governments, he has been taking shots for a long time.\n4: A Feb. 8 Facebook post recycled an August 2018 image that poses the question, \"Bernie Sanders: Communist traitor?\"\n5: It continues: \"The Vermont Senator collaborated with Marxist regimes in the Soviet Union, Nicaragua and Cuba in the 1980s when America was on the verge of winning the Cold War.\"\n6: Some quick timeposts: When he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders visited Nicaragua in 1985, the Soviet Union in 1988 (three years before its collapse) and Cuba in 1989.\n7: The question is, did he collaborate with those governments?\n8: By the plain meaning of the word, he did not.\n9: Collaborate means for two or more people to work together, while a more loaded political meaning is associated with treason.\n10: Neither applies to Sanders.\n11: What\u2019s true is Sanders said nice things about each of the countries.\n12: In particular he gave Nicaragua and Cuba, both small nations targeted by the United States, the benefit of the doubt.\n13: Some see that as actively undermining the United States\u2019 foreign policy.\n14: However, Sanders also criticized each place.\n15: The words he used to describe their shortcomings might not satisfy everyone, but they do indicate that he tempered his praise.\n16: Nicaragua Here are some key excerpts from Sanders\u2019 press conference in Vermont , after his 1985 trip to Nicaragua: \"My goal was not to determine how good or bad the Nicaraguan government is.\n17: I\u2019m not an expert.\n18: My major concern is that there is a real possibility that the United States is about to enter into a Vietnam type war in Central America.\n19: I think that such a war would not only be a disaster for the Nicaraguan people, but a disaster for the people of the United States as well.\n20: Others may disagree with me, but I do not believe it is in the interests of the people of our country to have young men and women fighting and dying in the jungles of Central America.\"\n21: \"Many people believe the Sandinista government has made significant progress in such vital areas as health care education, agriculture and land reform and the distribution of food.\n22: They have also gone a long way in extending democrtic rights to a country which has no democratic history.\"\n23: \"As poor as Nicaragua is, one of the nice things that I saw, is that as a result of government policy, in terms of the distribution of food, people are not hungry, by and large.\"\n24: \"I am not here to defend every action of the Nicaraguan government.\n25: Do I think I got to all sides of the story and talked to everybody?\n26: The answer is, \u2018No.\u2019\" When reporters pressed Sanders on the government\u2019s violent repression of indigenous people, Sanders said the situation was \"complicated.\"\n27: He said that some government officials said they didn\u2019t like what happened, but that he wasn\u2019t expert enough to comment.\n28: In a letter to a constituent , he wrote, \"Nicaragua, a tiny impoverished nation of 3 million, is today fighting a brutal war \u2014 with their enemy being totally financed by the most powerful nation on earth.\"\n29: The cities of Burlington and Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua became sister cities.\n30: Under that program, the city sent 500 tons of supplies and humanitarian aid in 1986.\n31: Critics cast this as supporting the government of Nicaragua.\n32: Yaroslavl, USSR After Sanders and a group from Burlington returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, the travelers shared their impressions on June 13, 1988 .\n33: Here are excerpts of Sanders\u2019 comments from that: \"They (Soviet officials) are absolutely open in acknowledging that they are not a democratic society and that those people we spoke to want to become a democratic society, and right now they are in the midst of an extraordinarily important and turbulent point in their history.\n34: At least some of them want to try to determine how they go from where they are today to become a more open and democratic society.\"\n35: \"While they are proud that their health care system is free, and we went to one of their medical schools and they\u2019re proud of that, they estimate that they are 10 or 15 years behind the United States in terms of new medical technology.\n36: They are making, at least in the Yaroslavl area, significant advances in building housing.\n37: They have a major housing crisis which they acknowledge, but they acknowledge that not only do they not have enough housing, but the construction and the quality of the housing is also not adequate.\"\n38: \"We were saying, yeah, in our country we also have a housing crisis.\n39: Our housing in general is better than yours but people are paying 40% of their income for housing.\n40: The quality of your housing is not good, but we appreciate the fact that people are paying 5%.\n41: The quality of your health care we understand is not good, but in the United States, believe me, we have enormous problems in terms of our health care system.\"\n42: Cuba In March 1989, Sanders held a news conference after his trip to Cuba.\n43: According to the Burlington Free Press , Sanders praised Cuba for delivering essential services to its people, and criticized it for suppressing political opponents.\n44: \"I did not see a hungry child,\" Sanders said.\n45: \"I did not see any homeless people.\n46: Cuba today not only has free health care, but very high-quality health care.\"\n47: In terms of personal freedoms, Sanders had a different take.\n48: \"Cuba is not a perfect society,\" he said.\n49: \"There are political prisoners in Cuba.\"\n50: Sanders said the people he met had \"almost a religious affection for\" Fidel Castro.\n51: \"The revolution there is far deeper and more profound than I had understood it to be,\" Sanders said.\n52: \"It really is a revolution in terms of values.\"\n53: Opposing authoritarian regimes In a Feb. 21 , 2020, interview with Telemundo, an interviewer pressed Sanders on the places with socialism he supports, such as Denmark, and the places he does not.\n54: \"In those countries that you're talking about, Venezuela, Cuba, and now Nicaragua unfortunately, you're talking about authoritarian societies,\" Sanders said.\n55: \"You're talking about the old Soviet Union.\n56: You're talking about an authoritarian, communist society.\n57: I don't support those.\n58: I have, my entire life, been fighting authoritarianism, whether it is communism, whether it's fascism, whatever it may be.\n59: I believe in democracy.\n60: We're here today to encourage people to vote.\"\n61: Defining collaboration The Oxford dictionary says collaboration involves at least two people working on something together.\n62: But in a political context, it\u2019s a more loaded term.\n63: A collaborator is \"a person who cooperates traitorously with an enemy.\"\n64: Cold War historian Marc Trachtenberg at UCLA said the term doesn\u2019t apply to Sanders.\n65: \"Collaborator means he worked together with them, which he never actually did, to my knowledge,\" Trachtenberg said.\n66: \"It has a very negative connotation, since it calls up memories of people in occupied Europe, especially France, who collaborated with the Nazis in World War II in rounding up Jews, etc.\n67: \u2018Sympathizer\u2019 would be a better term, but even using that would be going a bit too far, since Sanders sympathized with those regimes only in part.\"\n68: In practice, the word applies when there\u2019s active repression of others in direct service to a powerful group.\n69: In 2007, the archbishop of Warsaw resigned after he admitted that he had worked with Poland\u2019s Communist-era secret police.\n70: In 2016 , new documents indicated that Polish leader Lech Walesa also was a paid informer.\n71: \"Mr Walesa strenuously denied long-standing allegations of collaboration in a BBC interview in 2008 ,\" the BBC reported.",

        "passage": "0: A blog post from five years ago that claims President Barack Obama ordered the CIA to train members of ISIS continues to circulate on the internet, despite the fact that it severely mischaracterizes the intent and outcome of a CIA operation.\n1: In 2013, the CIA operated a program that both trained and armed Syrian rebels in an attempt to support stronger opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n2: The program had some unintended consequences \u2014 at times, weapons intended for Syrian rebels were stolen and sold on the black market, for example \u2014 but it was never designed to \"train ISIS Jihadists,\" as the post claims.\n3: \"Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists,\" reads the over-the-top headline.\n4: The blog post bases its claims primarily on a once-classified Defense Intelligence Agency document obtained by Judicial Watch , a conservative legal group.\n5: On top of falsely alleging that Obama ordered the CIA to intentionally train members of ISIS, the post claims the released document confirms the United States and its partners \"actually facilitated the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as an effective adversary against the government of the Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad.\"\n6: The post also says that the DIA document \"declared that President Barack Obama and his counterparts within the coalition considered the establishment of a Salafist organization in eastern Syria in order to further downfall of the Assad regime.\"\n7: The reality is not that simple.\n8: The training program Despite what the post\u2019s headline says, Obama never ordered the CIA to train members of ISIS.\n9: In fact, the New York Times reported that Obama only \"reluctantly agreed\" to the training program to train and arm some Syrian rebels opposing Assad\u2019s government forces.\n10: The program, code named Timber Sycamore , was a joint effort primarily between the CIA and other Arab intelligence agencies.\n11: The program and its details are still largely classified.\n12: Most of what we know comes from media reports.\n13: The New York Times, for example, reported that the program trained thousands of fighters and was going well until Russian military aid forced the rebels to retreat.\n14: But there were other problems.\n15: In October 2015, the BBC reported that American officials admitted only four or five of the program\u2019s trainees \"had actually returned to the battle.\"\n16: Further, an Al Jazeera and New York Times investigation revealed that millions of dollars in weapons the CIA meant to provide Syrian rebels had actually been systematically stolen and sold on the black market.\n17: From there, the weapons could fall into the wrong hands.\n18: Once, stolen CIA-supplied weapons were used in a shooting in Amman, Jordan, that killed five people, including two Americans.\n19: The declassified document The document obtained by Judicial Watch said Salafi-jihadists \u2014 fundamentalists who believe in the return to traditional Islam practices \u2014 the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida in Iraq were \"the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.\"\n20: While the document does not say anything about Obama, it seemed to explore some of the CIA training program\u2019s potential effects on Iraq.\n21: \"If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in Eastern Syria,\" reads the document.\n22: \"And this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian Regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).\"\n23: Essentially, the document seems to say that the groups it identified as the \"major forces\" in the region supporting Syrian rebels hoped to establish a Salafist state in Eastern Syria.\n24: The document did not say the United States considered supporting this outcome, however.",

        "passage": "0: In the latest push from Republicans to advance a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks and a requirement for doctors to treat infants born after an attempted abortion , U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke in favor of the efforts from the Senate floor.\n1: In his remarks, Cruz urged his Democratic colleagues to support these kinds of \"common sense propositions,\" a departure from the party\u2019s \"extreme\" position on abortion.\n2: Neither bill \u2014 versions of which GOP lawmakers have attempted to pass several times over multiple years \u2014 was approved .\n3: \"We\u2019ve seen far too many Democrats embrace extreme positions on abortion: abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that,\" Cruz said, before highlighting a radio interview Virginia Gov.\n4: Ralph Northam gave in 2019 about a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates regulating third-trimester abortions.\n5: \"This bill was allowing a mother in labor, in the process of delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child instead of delivering that child in the midst of labor,\" Cruz said.\n6: \"The idea of killing a child while the mother is in labor instead of delivering the infant is horrifying beyond words.\"\n7: Cruz\u2019s claim that Democrats support abortion up until birth and \"even, horrifically, after that,\" is inaccurate, as is his characterization of the Virginia proposal (which was unsuccessful).\n8: Trump claims This isn\u2019t the first time a Republican leader has used an inaccurate description of the Virginia bill to advance legislation to require care for infants \"born alive\" after attempted abortions.\n9: When Senate Republicans attempted to pass a version of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act in February 2019, President Donald Trump offered two inaccurate claims on this front.\n10: Speaking at a rally in El Paso, he said that Northam \"stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world ... then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.\"\n11: We rated this claim False.\n12: In a tweet sent days later, Trump said: \"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\"\n13: We rated that claim False.\n14: To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal.\n15: Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \"born alive at any stage of development.\"\n16: Virginia legislation This characterization of Democrats as supporters of allowing abortions during and after a live birth surfaced in early 2019, when a subcommittee of the Virginia House of Delegates considered a bill aimed at loosening the state\u2019s abortion laws.\n17: In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period.\n18: After that point, abortions are legal if they happen in a hospital and three physicians certify that \"the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\"\n19: The law also requires physicians to make \"measures for life support for the product of such abortion\" available if there is \"any clearly visible evidence of viability\" after an attempted abortion.\n20: The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester.\n21: The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold in the law.\n22: At the time of the debate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that there were two confirmed third-trimester abortions performed in Virginia since 2000.\n23: Republican lawmakers questioned the bill\u2019s sponsor on the scope of the proposal, asking whether the measure would allow a woman who is dilating to get a abortion.\n24: \"My bill would allow that,\" said Democratic lawmaker Kathy Tran.\n25: \"Yes.\"\n26: Her response sparked intense backlash from anti-abortion advocates and footage of her remark circulated quickly on social media.\n27: But days later, Tran said she misspoke : \"I should have said: \u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\u2019\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion.\n28: It did not change the law as it relates to when such an abortion could take place.\n29: As the law stands, abortion is legal in the third trimester only in cases where three physicians certify that the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\n30: Virginia law prohibits \"partial birth infanticide,\" the killing of an infant who has \"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\"\n31: Northam\u2019s comments In a radio interview two days after the debate, Northam discussed the legislation and offered a confusing comment about third-trimester abortions: \"It\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities.\n32: There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable.\n33: So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.\n34: The infant would be delivered.\n35: The infant would be kept comfortable.\n36: The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"\n37: A number of anti-abortion advocates accused the Democratic governor of approving the killing of infants.\n38: Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality.\n39: This can include issues like anencephaly, when an infant is born without parts of the brain and skull, and limb-body wall complex, when an infant's organs have developed outside of its body.\n40: In these cases, where there is \"little or no prospect\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care , or comfort care \u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts.\n41: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\"\n42: Cruz\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to this care as an example of a doctor completing an abortion by denying medical care.\n43: This type of care is rare \u2014 a study of deaths at children\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion.\n44: Harvard Medical School defines abortion as \"the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus.\"",

$96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020.\n32: However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills.\n33: Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills \u2014 bills signed by Trump \u2014 that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year.\n34: As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020.\n35: (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration.\n36: The figures for 2020 are preliminary.)\n37: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It\u2019s important to note that Trump has asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus.\n38: House Democrats quickly said the amount was insufficient to meet current threats, and Trump said he was willing to seek more if lawmakers were willing.\n39: In addition, the Trump campaign pointed to consistent funding for certain budget sub-categories, such as CDC\u2019s public health emergency preparedness, which helps states and localities deal with public health emergencies, including outbreaks.\n40: That program suffered funding losses that predate Trump.",

Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor.\n35: If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49.\n36: That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote .\n37: Other scenarios are equally hypothetical.",

Pritzker is pinning many of his budget goals for the coming fiscal year on voters approving a ballot measure permitting the state to raise tax rates on high earners.\n2: Without approval of the constitutional amendment in November, which would permit Illinois to institute higher rates on those making more than $250,000 a year, the governor\u2019s proposed budget holds back a $1.4 billion revenue boost to education and other state services.\n3: In an interview on WTTW the week after Pritzker\u2019s budget address, the chairman of the campaign to pass the ballot measure was asked to defend the tax plan, which opponents say will drive residents and businesses from the state.\n4: \"I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any correlation between individuals leaving a state and tax rates,\" said Quentin Fulks, who chairs the Vote Yes for Fairness campaign and previously worked for Pritzker\u2019s 2018 campaign for governor.\n5: Fulks cited the high number of millionaires in California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, and then made a claim that caught our attention.\n6: California, he said, \"has a top tax rate of 13.3%, which is a pretty high tax rate, and people aren\u2019t leaving.\"\n7: The proposal in Illinois would take the top tax rate to nearly 8%.\n8: In raw numbers, California saw more people overall depart for other states during the last year than any other, according to the U.S. Census Bureau .\n9: So we decided to find out what Fulks meant when he said \"people aren\u2019t leaving\" California and whether its highest-in-the-nation top marginal rate specifically has affected its population.\n10: Just millionaires \u2014 not overall population We\u2019ve fact - checked statements from Illinois politicians on both sides of the debate about how graduated-tax states are faring, including a False claim that New York sent its wealthy fleeing the state after instituting a tax structure requiring them to pay more.\n11: Fulks was also talking about top earners, a spokesperson told us.\n12: \"If you look at Quentin\u2019s answer on WTTW, it\u2019s clear he is referencing those who pay the 13.3% tax rate in California \u2013 those making over a million dollars \u2013 as those who are not leaving the state,\" Vote Yes for Fairness spokesperson Lara Sisselman wrote in an email.\n13: Fulks\u2019 phrasing on WTTW was less than clear.\n14: He was asked about people and businesses leaving the state generally, and did not explicitly state that the wealthy weren\u2019t leaving California.\n15: That said, the overall context of his remarks in that portion of the interview do suggest he was referring to those who actually pay the top rate he cited.\n16: Even if Fulks had only been speaking about California\u2019s population more generally, he\u2019d have a point when it comes to whether the state\u2019s 2012 tax hike has driven Californians away.\n17: More people have left California for elsewhere in the country than moved there from other states in each year since that tax increase.\n18: But like Illinois , that\u2019s been the case for decades.\n19: California\u2019s overall population has continued to grow due to immigration from abroad and having more births than deaths.\n20: California \"has suffered domestic migration losses (movement into and out of other parts of the U.S.) since at least 2000 and for some years prior to that,\" Brookings Institution demographer William Frey wrote in an email, citing an analysis of census estimates he shared with us.\n21: Assessing millionaire migration change To Fulks\u2019 point, only the state\u2019s wealthiest pay its top rate \u2014 though like Pritzker\u2019s plan, rates also went up to a lesser degree on those making more than $250,000.\n22: California did not raise rates on income below that amount.\n23: From 2005 to 2012, income over $1 million had been taxed at 10.3% there.\n24: So we turned to research assessing the effect the 2012 increase had on migration among those subject to the rate Fulks highlighted.\n25: Some of the findings support his case, others do not.\n26: His spokesperson cited a finding from a 2018 report by researchers at the Stanford Center on Poverty & Inequality that shows net migration of millionaires overall since 2007 has remained positive.\n27: However, the study also found \u2014\u00a0based on an analysis that compared migration changes with a control group of high earners not subject to the top rate \u2014 that the 2012 increase did indeed lead to a small loss of 0.04% of California\u2019s millionaire population.\n28: \"Our overall conclusion is, yes, millionaires do sometimes move to lower-tax states \u2014 as we see for California in 2012,\" researcher Cristobal Young told us in an email.\n29: \"In 2012, there was a large tax increase that produced millionaire out-migration \u2014 but by an amount that was too small to matter for overall state revenues or tax policy,\" he said.\n30: Using the same set of tax data, researchers at Stanford\u2019s conservative Hoover Institution found a larger increase in the rate of departures among top earners after 2012.\n31: Their report defined a departing taxpayer more broadly than Young and his colleague did and did not address net migration.\n32: Meanwhile, reports by California\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research arm and the Sacramento Bee have found that since the early 2000s, the state has gained rather than lost residents making over $100,000.",

        "passage": "0: Since late 2019, social media users have been sharing posts urging people to call 911 at the sight of a white van with external locks on its doors and hatches.\n1: \"If you see any vans like this call 911,\" says a Nov. 22 Facebook post , which shows an image of a white van with external locks on its side door and hatch.\n2: \"This is utilized for sex trafficking.\"\n3: The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\n4: (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n5: Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people.\n6: But while it\u2019s possible that some human traffickers have used white vans to kidnap their victims, there\u2019s generally no way to predict what type of vehicle a trafficker or other criminal would drive.\n7: More to the point, there\u2019s no evidence that white vans with external locks are an especially common getaway ride for kidnappers.\n8: Like a pair of similar hoaxes we debunked related to zip ties and sex trafficking, this post seems alarmist.\n9: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A screenshot of a viral Facebook post warning that white vans with external locks are used by sex traffickers.\u200b When we searched news archives, we didn\u2019t find a swarm of reports about human traffickers who used external locks to trap people inside their white vans and drive away.\n10: Instead, we found a number of reports \u2014 from fact-checkers as well as local and national news outlets \u2014 that debunked viral Facebook posts that were fooling people into believing most white vans belonged to sex traffickers.\n11: Some outlets, like Lead Stories , knocked down posts claiming white vans with external locks are the vehicle of choice for sex traffickers, noting that such locks are widely available for sale online and commonly used by workers who use expensive tools on the job.\n12: Others dealt with similar posts that warned about white vans more generally.\n13: These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were \"trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.\"\n14: Young said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks.\n15: A number of white-van owners have reported being harassed since posts associating their vehicles with sex trafficking have cropped up, according to Business Insider .\n16: The FBI declined to comment when we asked if incidents involving white vans were frequent or if white vans with external locks presented any particular reason for concern.\n17: But Robert Lowery, vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , told Yahoo News that \"of the 420,000 missing children last year, there were around 30 or 40 physical abductions that involved, for example, grabbing them in public.\"\n18: \"Although that\u2019s too many and it does happen, these scenarios are rare,\" he said.\n19: In a statement to PolitiFact, the Polaris Project , a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said it hasn\u2019t identified white vans with external locks as a trend.\n20: Human trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and people being trafficked aren\u2019t always physically restrained, locked away or held against their will, the group said.\n21: \"By far the most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it always \u2014 or often \u2014 involves kidnapping or otherwise physically forcing someone into a situation,\" the Polaris Project said in its statement.\n22: \"In reality, most human traffickers use psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims.\"\n23: Shared Hope International , a nonprofit Christian organization with a similar mission, told us that \"trafficking victims are generally not kidnapped or taken away from their families abruptly.\"\n24: \"Many people don\u2019t realize sex trafficking exists in their community, but it impacts people everywhere,\" the organization said.\n25: \"Those who are concerned about sex trafficking and want to prevent people from being exploited should start by educating themselves and getting the facts.\"\n26: It\u2019s important to stay aware of your surroundings, and should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email help@humantraffickinghotline.org .\n27: But the Facebook post about white vans with external locks seems like an example of an alarmist and unsubstantiated warning.",

        "label": "true",
        "passage": "0: From Republican U.S. Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the economy under President Trump.\n1: From Democratic Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the need for better health care policy.\n2: Nowhere is that more true than North Carolina, where a handful of Democrats are vying to knock out incumbent Republican Thom Tillis.\n3: One of them is Cal Cunningham, who has support from the Democratic Party establishment.\n4: The Cunningham campaign recently released an ad accusing Tillis of voting to \"take away\" coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n5: The Feb. 5 tweet says, \"Without coverage for pre-existing conditions, Susie and her family would be bankrupt.\n6: Those protections are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away.\"\n7: Included in the tweet is a video that profiles a mother named Susie who says her daughter has a pre-existing condition.\n8: \"Without pre-existing condition coverage, we would be bankrupt,\" Susie says.\n9: Cunningham then appears on screen to say, \"Those protections for Susie\u2019s children are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away.\"\n10: Then this text appears over a photo of Tillis: \"Tillis voted against protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n11: Is it true that Tillis voted to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions?\n12: Yes.\n13: Tillis voted to repeal a law, the Affordable Care Act, that provides that coverage.\n14: While repeal efforts have been unsuccessful, repealing and replacing the ACA has been part of the Tillis platform for years.\n15: He voted to repeal the ACA, and later proposed a different law that aims to address pre-existing conditions.\n16: But experts say the Tillis plan, along with other Republican proposals, fall short of offering the coverage in the ACA.\n17: About the vote First, some background.\n18: A pre-existing condition is a health problem that someone has before their health coverage starts.\n19: Examples include asthma, cancer, diabetes or lupus.\n20: Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or inflate their premiums so much that they dropped coverage, as PolitiFact and its partners have previously reported.\n21: The Cunningham ad specifically mentions a vote from July 26, 2015: the roll call for a vote to allow the repeal of the health care law.\n22: You can see from the bill\u2019s \"statement of purpose\" that it was meant to \"repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.\"\n23: The record shows Tillis voted to repeal it.\n24: \"Certainly, this provision, if enacted, would have removed coverage of pre-existing conditions because it would have repealed the ACA in its entirety, which would have restored law to what it was prior to 2010, when pre-existing conditions often were not covered in most states, or by federal law,\" said Mark Hall, a law and health professor at Wake Forest University.\n25: PolitiFact has repeatedly determined that a vote to repeal the ACA in full would have stripped coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n26: Subsequent GOP-written bills to replace the ACA have not ensured the same level of patients with those conditions.\n27: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What Tillis said When PolitiFact reached out to the Tillis campaign, spokesman Andrew Romeo didn\u2019t dispute Tillis\u2019 vote from 2015.\n28: But he claimed Tillis has always supported replacing Obamacare \"with a health care law that retains that critical provision, in addition to ensuring Americans under the age of 26 can stay on their family's health plan,\" Romeo said.\n29: He added that Tillis has \"taken steps to ensure that patients with pre-existing conditions maintain those protections regardless of Obamacare's future.\"\n30: Romeo was referencing a bill Tillis co-sponsored known as \" The Protect Act ,\" which claims to protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n31: But experts say that bill falls short.\n32: Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow studying health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bill doesn\u2019t prevent insurance companies from price gouging.\n33: The bill includes language prohibiting discrimination based on health status.\n34: But, Pollitz said, it doesn\u2019t prohibit insurers from charging women more than men.\n35: She paraphrased lines on pages 9 and 10 of the bill , saying \"nothing in the nondiscrimination requirement \u2018shall be construed to restrict the amount that an employer or individual may be charged for coverage under a group health plan except as provided in paragraph 3 or individual health coverage\u2019.\"\n36: Pollitz said Tillis may have attempted to include price-gouging protections, \"but the language they used is riddled with loopholes that would continue to permit discriminatory rating practices.\"\n37: To prevent price gouging, health bills should offer subsidies.\n38: Tillis\u2019 bill guaranteed the issuance of insurance but didn\u2019t provide funding to make premiums affordable, said David Anderson, research associate at Duke University\u2019s Center for Health Policy.\n39: About the GOP plans Under Tillis\u2019 bill, Anderson said there was little incentive to keep healthy people in the market pool.\n40: So insurers would have two options.\n41: \"They can either leave the market entirely or dramatically increase premiums to cover a very sick and expensive group of people,\" he said.\n42: \"Since there are no premium subsidies in this bill, insurance will be too expensive for individuals who are in good health to purchase.\"\n43: PolitiFact reported in 2019 that most of the Republican health care plans fail to fully protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n44: A fact-check of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney singled out the plan proposed by Tillis and other Republican senators.\n45: It found that the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if they weren\u2019t able to \"adequately\" deliver services.\n46: That fact-check quote critics of Obamacare, such as health care consultant Bob Laszewski and former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock, saying the Republican proposals fall short of the coverage offered by the ACA.",

        "label": "false",
        "passage": "0: During a Senate appropriations Feb. 25 subcommittee hearing, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said the U.S. flu mortality rate was about the same as the current estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak.\n1: He made this statement during an exchange with Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.)\n2: regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19.\n3: This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two.\n4: Kennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"under 2%\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"it changes daily.\"\n5: The Louisiana senator then asked, \"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\n6: Wolf answered: \"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well.\n7: I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\n8: We asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from.\n9: A DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\n10: The comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up.\n11: We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk.\n12: Digging into mortality rate numbers The CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus.\n13: Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures.\n14: He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%.\n15: That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n16: Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\n17: It\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually.\n18: Now, for coronavirus.\n19: According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%.\n20: That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus.\n21: (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.)\n22: But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus.\n23: \"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores.\n24: \"They have changed their case definitions multiple times.\n25: It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\n26: The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%.\n27: Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%.\n28: Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%.\n29: Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate.\n30: \"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\" said Osterholm.\n31: Mores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar.\n32: Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus.\n33: It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness.\n34: \"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy.\n35: So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\" he said.\n36: \"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\n37: Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment.\n38: It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\"\n39: Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality.\n40: But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down.\n41: This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores.\n42: The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis.\n43: One key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness.\n44: Mores concurred.\n45: \"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it.\n46: Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\" he said.\n47: \"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"",

        "passage": "0: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., hammered home his message against billionaire Mike Bloomberg at a Democratic presidential debate.\n1: \"Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans,\" Sanders said during the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas.\n2: \"That\u2019s wrong.\n3: That\u2019s amoral.\"\n4: We wanted to know if Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, was really richer than 38% of the country.\n5: After digging into the data, we found that Sanders was basically correct about how Bloomberg\u2019s fortune compares with the rest of the country.\n6: The facts behind this claim, in many ways, underscore Sanders' broader message about income inequality.\n7: That said, some quirks in how wealth is distributed among households mean that millions of American \u2014 not just Bloomberg \u2014 own more wealth than millions of their compatriots.\n8: Let\u2019s walk through the numbers.\n9: Bloomberg\u2019s net worth, as listed by Forbes magazine\u2019s richest list, was $64.2 billion at the time of the Feb. 19 debate.\n10: That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes .\n11: The other half of the comparison is more complicated.\n12: The Sanders campaign\u2019s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project , a think tank that has \"a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas.\"\n13: Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve \"summary extract public data ,\" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households.\n14: (The \"bottom 38%\" here refers to the lowest 38% of households in wealth.)\n15: When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve\u2019s Summary Extract Public Data , which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software.\n16: Bruenig provided us the code that he used with Python, a programming language.\n17: Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth.\n18: He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion.\n19: Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million.\n20: You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household ) to come up with 125.7 million people.\n21: Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig\u2019s math.\n22: (He was recommended by Fabian T. Pfeffer, a University of Michigan sociologist who specializes in wealth inequality.)\n23: Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig\u2019s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined.\n24: Specifically, Gross found that the aggregate wealth of the bottom 37% of households is -$44 billion.\n25: That means these households have more debt than they have assets.\n26: Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion.\n27: Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had.\n28: In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red.",

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she didn\u2019t want to keep rehashing the past.\n1: Instead, she said, she\u2019s focused on the way forward.\n2: Klobuchar then went on to outline a series of issues she believes demand attention.\n3: One of them was voting rights, and she used Wisconsin to underscore her point.\n4: \"While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls,\" she said Feb. 25, 2020 in South Carolina .\n5: Wisconsin\u2019s voter rolls have been front and center in recent months after the state Election Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved, asking them to update their registrations if relevant.\n6: The plan was to remove them from the rolls in 2021.\n7: That prompted a lawsuit from a conservative law group contending those voters should be taken off the rolls now.\n8: The matter ultimately may go to the state Supreme Court .\n9: Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said she was referring to voter purges in 2017 and 2018 \u2014 not those at the center of the lawsuit.\n10: But that doesn\u2019t explain why she implied it was happening right then.\n11: (Note: Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential campaign March 2, 2020, after a sixth-place finish in South Carolina , as we were working on this fact-check.\n12: We decided to complete it, since removal of voters from the state\u2019s rolls is an ongoing issue.)\n13: Let\u2019s see where Klobuchar\u2019s claim lands.\n14: Changes to Wisconsin\u2019s voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar\u2019s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016.\n15: This included 44,000 voters in Milwaukee alone .\n16: The decline stemmed from two separate actions in 2017 and 2018, according to Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n17: To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn\u2019t voted in four years and didn\u2019t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations.\n18: Over half of those voters didn\u2019t respond, and roughly 43% of the notices were returned as undeliverable.\n19: Some people had died or were deactivated for other reasons.\n20: Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency\u2019s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration.\n21: Once officials realized there were problems with accuracy of that list, they implemented a supplemental poll book to ensure anyone incorrectly removed could vote without reregistering.\n22: The commission later said it found few examples of voters who were removed inappropriately.\n23: So, the commission did deactivate hundreds of thousands of voters in 2017 and 2018.\n24: But by saying they were \"kicked off,\" Klobuchar suggests the motive was voter suppression.\n25: Magney disputes that.\n26: In any case, Wisconsin has same-day registration, so removal from the rolls does not prevent people from voting, as it might in some states if done too close to election day.\n27: The latest election saga There is another problem with Klobuchar\u2019s statement: She said Wisconsin has purged voters \"while we are all sitting here debating.\"\n28: That suggests the issue is immediate \u2014 not one from several years ago.\n29: As we noted, Wisconsin is currently in the throes of a controversy over its voter rolls.\n30: The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty , representing three suburban Milwaukee men, filed a lawsuit arguing that 234,000 voters who may have moved and received notices in the mail should be removed from the rolls within 30 days if they don\u2019t respond.\n31: The commission had said it wouldn\u2019t suspend registrations until after April 2021.\n32: Critics of the lawsuit believe any voter purge would be an affront to the democratic process and could inadvertently affect voters who didn\u2019t even move.\n33: The case has drawn heightened attention because of Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal role in this year\u2019s presidential race.\n34: In December 2019, an Ozaukee County judge sided with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and ordered the election commission to remove those people from the voter rolls .",
